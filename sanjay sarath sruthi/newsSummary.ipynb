Compound annual growth rate\\xa0is a measure of\\xa0annualized returns for an investment over a period of time, assuming profits are reinvested at the end of each year.\\xa0\\nIn a media release, Wong said \"the effects of China\\'s reopening post-pandemic, the rise of ASEAN for the China plus one strategy and other geopolitical factors\" have amplified the potential business flows between the two regions.\\nAs such, while the OCBC has seen slowing economic growth in some countries in the region, Wong said she\\'s confident it will be able to capture growth as it \"puts our act together.\"\\nThis will be done by improving how it deals with customers digitally, as well as improving the way the bank captures customers and businesses, she said without offering more details.\\nShe also pointed out that OCBC and its subsidiaries service the top seven markets in ASEAN, and can rely on a presence in 17 cities in the Greater China region, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, as well as its partnership with the Bank of Ningbo.\\nAsked about the bank\\'s outlook for the next half of 2023, Wong said it will \"probably will be quite stable.\"\\nShe said the high interest rate environment has helped its interest income, even as income from fees has fallen as investors hold back on investing due to the uncertain economic environment.\\nBut OCBC has other revenue streams that could contribute to growth, such as insurance income, Wong said.\\nHowever, she also acknowledged there may be uncertainty as interest rates could potentially remain at current levels or be \"a little bit higher.\"\\nAs a result, OCBC will have to pay attention to whether its credit portfolio may be impacted by prolonged high interest rates. Also, if rates continue to be high, customers are likely to be \"a little bit on the sidelines as to their investment activities,\" Wong pointed out.\\nAs a regional bank — Southeast Asia\\'s second largest — OCBC also saw some money come in from the collapse of regional banks in the U.S. earlier this year.\\n\"Whenever there are some changes, some weakness in certain parts of the industry, there is a flight to quality. So being a highly rated bank, sitting in Asia, we do see some of that new money coming in,\" she said.\\nHowever, the objective is not only to have the money come in, but keeping the money with OCBC.\\nTo that, Wong highlighted that the bank has to ask itself: \"Is there any lesson learned? How does that actually impact customers? Are we equipped to serve the customers as money comes in as well?\"\\nOCBC shares are higher by nearly 9% in the last 12 months, and closed at 12.30 Singapore dollars on Monday.\\n',\n",

He was referring to Hong Kong as a testing bed for Meituan which may eventually expand internationally.\\nThe penetration rate of food delivery in Hong Kong is not particularly high.\\nCurrently, about 10% of the overall restaurant industry\\xa0taps on food delivery services — that\\'s compared to an average of 21% across China two years ago, according to a report from research firm Momentum Works.\\nThat\\'s because \"ordering food delivery is not as common a habit in Hong Kong as it is in mainland China,\" said\\xa0the report, adding that the\\xa0Asian financial hub\\xa0has a high density of food and beverage establishments on every street corner.\\nAnalysts reveal a $12 billion opportunity to tap the A.I. buzz, naming stocks to play it\\nForget Nvidia: Fund manager says buy these two chip giants instead, giving one 30% upside\\nApple\\'s Vision Pro or Meta\\'s Quest? Analysts prefer one to play the future of VR tech\\nHong Kong\\'s food delivery market is currently dominated by Foodpanda and Deliveroo, which held shares of 64% and 36% respectively in May before KeeTa\\'s launch, according to data provider Measurable AI. The data takes into account both delivery and pickup orders.\\xa0\\nKeeTa does not currently offer food pickup services, only delivery services.\\nUber Eats\\xa0exited Hong Kong\\xa0at the end of 2021 after five years of operating in the territory. It held about 5% market share at the time of its exit, according to Measurable AI.\\n\"If there has already been like two or three major players in this market, then it\\'s actually very difficult to change consumers\\' mindsets, unless they do a lot of subsidy campaigns,\" said Yang of Blue Lotus Research.\\n″[KeeTa\\'s expansion into Hong Kong] should lead to more vouchers and discounts for consumers. And it should benefit consumers in the long term,\" said Wang from Morningstar.\\nSeparately, Hong Kong has launched a probe into\\xa0anti-competitive\\xa0conduct from Deliveroo and Foodpanda. That means players cannot engage in practices such as restricting restaurants or penalizing them for switching to partnering exclusively with other platforms. \\nThis could mean smaller players such as KeeTa may be able to build market share.\\nIn a bid to acquire new users, KeeTa is\\xa0offering 300 Hong Kong dollars ($38.30) worth of free vouchers for each new user\\xa0that can be used to offset meals and delivery fees. The company\\xa0\"plans to further launch various marketing activities in the new district\" such as free delivery for all, as well as referral discounts and food deals.\\nKeeTa is also offering set meals from HK$60 including delivery fees to address the painpoint of customers who dine alone. Foodpanda and Deliveroo\\'s minimum order requirements typically range from HK$50 to HK$80 excluding delivery fees, according to a CNBC check.\\nTo entice customers further, KeeTa launched an \"on-time promise\" policy to all users. Customers get compensated in vouchers if their orders are\\xa0more than 15 minutes later than the original estimate.\\nRyan Lai, managing director of Foodpanda Hong Kong, told CNBC that short-term promotions are not enough to establish customer loyalty in the longer run.\\n\"In such a competitive market landscape, we find that building strong customer stickiness is a key success factor,\" said Lai.\\n\"In our opinion, the entry of a new player in the local delivery space reflects the untapped growth potential of this industry in the market,\" he said, adding that Foodpanda will continue to serve its customers better.\\nOn the new entrant, a Deliveroo Hong Kong spokesperson said, \"Since Deliveroo first entered the Hong Kong market seven years ago, we have always been optimistic about the prospects of the local food and grocery industry, and as such, we see competition as a driving force for innovation.\"\\nRecently, the platform also launched the \"on-time promise\" policy for paid users — which compensates them with vouchers if their orders are late by 15 minutes or more.\\nHowever, the food delivery market in Hong Kong \"remains lukewarm,\" said Momentum Works in the report, which pointed out that\\xa0even during the pandemic, growth rates were moderate.\\nBut KeeTa can tap into its parent company\\'s expertise in China, said the research firm.\\n\"As long as Meituan has\\xa0determined leadership, selects\\xa0the right people, and\\xa0organizes its internal structure effectively, they should not worry about competition from the two incumbents.\"\\n',\n",

Excluding food and energy, the core PPI also rose 0.2%, in line with expectations. The core reading was the same excluding trade.\\nOn an annual basis, the headline PPI increased just 2.3%, down from 2.7% in March and the lowest reading since January 2021.\\nThough the PPI rise was less than expected, the services index increased 0.3%, the biggest move since November 2022, the Bureau of Labor Statistics report stated.\\nA separate Labor Department report Thursday showed that jobless claims for the week ended May 6 jumped to 264,000, a rise of 22,000 from the previous period. The total was well above the Dow Jones estimate for 245,000 and the highest reading since Oct. 30, 2021.

Central bankers have raised their benchmark interest rate 10 times since March 2022 while reducing bond holdings that had approached $9 trillion at one point.\\nIn a release Wednesday, the Labor Department said the consumer price index, a popular gauge of prices that consumers pay for a bevy of goods and services, increased 0.4% in April, equating to a 4.9% annual inflation rate. The latter number was the lowest reading since April 2021.\\nThe PPI differs from the CPI in that it measures prices that producers pay for the goods and services they need.\\nThe report showed that about one-third of the PPI services increase came from \"portfolio management\" services, which measures the prices for investment advice and increased 4.1%. Gasoline prices rose 8.4%, pushing the goods index higher by 0.2%.\\nOther notable increases came from food and alcohol wholesaling, outpatient care, and loan services.

       "    'content': 'Lansing, Michigan may never be the same. The city of just over 110,000 residents, known for its towering state capitol building, large convention center and proximity to college campuses, is trying to reshape itself for a post-Covid world.\\nIt\\'s been more than three years since the global pandemic sent workers accustomed to five-day, in-person work weeks away from offices. Many desk workers are still working from home for at least some of the week. That\\'s because remote and hybrid work models originally adopted as a short-term solution have shown staying power, even with the global public health emergency officially declared over.\\nThe trend has, in turn, changed the aesthetic and culture of downtown centers across the country that could once rely on an influx of commuters. In Lansing, that change is seen in different work hours, more housing and new event spaces as community and business leaders try to reimagine what and who the downtown caters to. It\\'s all being done in a bid to attract people to live or visit as reality sets in that Lansing and other cities can no longer thrive on office-centric economies.\\n\"We are looking at how do we shift our energy from serving mainly one type of demographic, to making sure that our downtown neighborhoods are welcoming and inclusive of all?\" said Cathleen Edgerly, executive director of Downtown Lansing, Inc., a nonprofit working on the culture and sustainability of the downtown. The goal is to build \"the downtown and community for those who want to be there, not those who are just coming in and out as fast as they can.\"\\nWorkers across the country have pushed to keep remote privileges even as executives at giant companies such as Disney to Tesla try to get their employees back into the office at least part time.\\xa0\\nA larger share of job listings across the country are offering at least one day of remote work compared with pre-pandemic, according to data from WFH Map in a collaboration between a group of researchers and Lightcast, a labor-market analytics firm. It\\'s a sign that flexible work experiences remain increasingly normal — and not just for jobs started before or during the pandemic.\\nLansing had the largest share of job listings in March with at least one day of remote work of any city, according to WFH Map. Founder Peter Lambert, an economic PhD candidate at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said capital cities and technology hubs tend to top the list given their tilt toward remote-friendly industries including tech, finance, insurance, higher education and government.\\n\"Lansing is a great case study, as it ticks all the above boxes,\" he said.\\nIn the downtown area, Edgerly said that initial shift meant a 30% overnight decrease in workers commuting in and over 1 million square feet of canceled office space with the onset of the pandemic. Since that shakeup, she said businesses have begun shifting hours to later in the evening and weekends as the economic focus moves away from commuters.\\nNew community-oriented spaces are also popping up. Plans for two entertainment venues have been announced in hopes of attracting visitors on nights and weekends. And, the owner of a Detroit food hall opened a similar space in Lansing earlier this year.\\nAbout 40% of first-floor retail shops sat vacant at one point, but that number has been falling. That is, according to Edgerly, due in part to the success of a micro-market business incubator created to help merchants find a low-barrier place to operate in Lansing for a year. Of the past participants, Edgerly said all are still in business and about four out of every five have opened permanently in the city.\\nBetween 300 and 400 residential housing units have also been added in the past few years, Edgerly said, as a comprehensive market analysis showed the need for more living spaces.\\nThere still is tourism given that Lansing is Michigan\\'s capital, though the city is not as large as others in the state such as Detroit. Around 115,000 people visit the capital each year, according to the government.\\nAt the Impression 5 Science Center, a museum, executive director Erik Larson said his team started training with the local tourism bureau to better promote the other experiences available to tourists. He said the goal is that more visitors will want to come if they realize all their options in a trip to the city.\\n\"It\\'s a rising tide,\" he said. \"We want the downtown core and beyond that to have a really strong, vibrant small business community.\"\\nState-wide initiatives such as the approval of outdoor business districts that allow the consumption of alcoholic beverages within their parameters have also helped build that economic fabric between businesses. A visitor or resident can now, for example, buy a beer to-go from a bar and peruse retail shops in one visit.\\nOther cities around the country are experiencing big changes to as well.\\nIn San Francisco, which has become somewhat of a national symbol for the office exodus, less than half of the number of workers commuting into the city before the pandemic came in on a weekly basis in the beginning of April, according to data from the city\\'s Office of Workforce and Development. And an analysis by Bloomberg found remote work has cost Manhattan more than $12 billion annually.\\nDespite the progress, challenges remain for the local economy.\\nKarl Dorshimer, president of the Lansing Economic Development Corporation, said the biggest challenge for businesses is still a continued worker shortage in the retail and service sectors. Rising wages enticed some workers back but have not fully solved the issue, he said. (Lansing\\'s unemployment rate is significantly lower than at the height of the pandemic, but it\\'s still above where it sat before stay-at-home orders took effect in 2020.)\\nThe cost of child care also remains a challenge, particularly for women in the local labor market, according to Keith Lambert, chief operating officer of the Lansing Economic Area Partnership. LEAP has helped start a coalition aimed at lowering child care costs after the issue\\'s impact on the workforce became unmistakable during the pandemic.\\nSimilarly, Lambert said large businesses are starting to think about their role in improving transportation in the region. A lack of parking has also hindered businesses and visitor interest downtown, according to multiple small business owners.\\nEconomic development leaders and business owners alike note there\\'s still room for progress. Mike Mahdi, owner of New Daily Bagel, said he still doesn\\'t have enough foot traffic to support weekends, but he\\'s noticed a better mix of street clothes and office attire among customers.\\nBut those who\\'ve seen the downtown\\'s ebbs and flows certainly recognize at least the first indications of a tide change. Stewart Powell, who has worked in the city for around four decades at Linn & Owen Jewelers, said he\\'s seen the shift away from the city acting as a \"very large food court\" to a more traditional city with a diverse mix of businesses and customers since the pandemic took hold.\\n\"I believe that in the long run, this will end up being a better place,\" he said. \"Not because of Covid, but in spite of Covid.\"\\n',\n",

The stress tests focus on how banks would respond to financial and economic crises.\\n\"Climate change is real, but I do not believe it poses a serious risk to the safety and soundness of large banks or the financial stability of the United States,\" Waller said. \"There is no need for us to focus on one set of risks in a way that crowds out our focus on others.\"\\nHe noted that events such as forest fires and other climate-connected disasters are \"devastating to local communities. But they are not material enough to pose an outsized risk to the overall U.S. economy.\"\\nWaller added that households and businesses, including banks, have shown the ability to adapt to changes. Bank performance, he said, is generally not affected by disasters in their regions.\\nFed officials for the past three years or so have been debating how much emphasis should be placed on climate risks.

A series of Fed rate cuts helped push 30-year mortgage rates to a low around 2.65% in January 2021.\\nBut rates are now around 6.4%, as the central bank has enacted 10 rate increases totaling 5 percentage points to fight inflation, according to central bank data through Fannie Mae. The higher rates helped push total mortgage debt to $12.04 trillion, up 0.1 percentage point from the fourth quarter.\\nBorrowers had used the previously lower rates both to buy new homes and to refinance, the latter seeing a boom that appears to have ended.\\n\"The mortgage refinancing boom is over, but its impact will be seen for decades to come,\" Andrew Haughwout, director of household and public policy research at the New York Fed, said in a statement accompanying the report.\\nFed data shows that about 14 million mortgages were refinanced during the pandemic period starting in March 2020. Some 64% were considered \"rate refinances,\" or homeowners looking to take advantage of lower borrowing costs. Average savings totaled about $220 per month for those borrowers, according to the New York Fed.\\n\"As a result of significant equity drawdowns, mortgage borrowers reduced their annual payments by tens of billions of dollars, providing additional funding for spending or paydowns in other debt categories,\" Haughwout said.\\nDespite rising rates, mortgage foreclosures remained low. Delinquency rates for all debt increased, up 0.6 percentage point for credit cards to 6.5% and 0.2 percentage point for auto loans to 6.9%. Total delinquency rates moved up 0.2 percentage point to 3%, the highest since the third quarter of 2020.\\nStudent loan debt edged higher to $1.6 trillion and auto loans nudged up as well to $1.56 trillion.\\n',\n",

Excluding auto-related figures, sales increased 0.4%, which was in line with expectations.\\nAs the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, the headline increase equaled the 0.4% monthly rise in the consumer price index. On an annual basis, sales were up just 1.6%, well below the 4.9% CPI pace.\\nA 0.8% drop in gasoline sales held back the spending figures. Sporting goods, music and book stores posted a 3.3% decline, while furniture and home furnishings saw a 0.7% drop.\\nMiscellaneous store retailers led gainers with a 2.4% increase, while online sales rose 1.2% and health and personal care retailers saw a 0.9% rise. Food and drink sales climbed 0.6% and were up 9.4% on a 12-month basis.\\n\"Retail sales posted a modest rebound in April, but the gain mostly reflected higher prices and a sustained turnaround is unlikely with consumer fundamentals turning less supportive,\" said Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon.\\nThough the report indicated a struggling consumer, it was the first positive reading since January and followed a 0.7% decline in March. Also, the control group, which excludes autos, gas stations, building materials and supply stores and food service and drinking establishments, rose 0.7%, above the 0.4% expectation.\\nOverall, the report \"was even stronger than our previous assumptions and indicates upside\" to the consumption outlook, Goldman Sachs economist Ronnie Walker said in a note.\\nTreasury yields rose after the report as the initial reaction focused more on the positive ex-autos number, though stocks were lower in morning trading.\\nConsumers still face a tough road ahead.\\nIndications are pointing to higher interest rates ahead. In fact, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic told CNBC on Monday that he thinks a rate hike would be more likely than the cuts markets have been pricing before the end of the year.\\nConsumers have been running up higher debts to deal with the persistently high inflation. Total debt rose above $17 trillion in the first quarter as higher rates pushed up borrowing costs for items such as mortgages and credit cards, according to a New York Federal Reserve report Monday.\\n\"As the labour market continues to cool and the drag from the Fed\\'s aggressive monetary tightening feeds through, we suspect a further slowdown lies ahead,\" wrote Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.\\nIn a speech Tuesday morning, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester noted the \"long-run costs\" of inflation and stressed that the central bank is committed to returning inflation to the 2% target.\\nOther economic news Tuesday saw a 0.5% increase in industrial production for April, better than the 0.1% estimate, according to the Federal Reserve. Capacity utilization was at 79.7%, just below the estimate.\\nAlso, the National Association of Home Builders sentiment index rose to 50 in May, better than the estimate for 46.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'LONDON — After more than a year of warnings, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey says the U.K. is now experiencing a wage-price spiral despite 12 consecutive central bank interest rate hikes.\\n\"Some of the strength in core inflation [in the U.K.] reflects the indirect effects of higher energy prices,\" Bailey said in a Wednesday speech. \"But it also reflects second-round effects as the external shocks we have seen interact with the state of the domestic economy.\"\\n\"As headline inflation falls, these second-round effects are unlikely to go away as quickly as they appeared.\"\\nThese areas of persistence, he continued, include domestic wage growth and price setting.\\nThis situation risks a wage-price spiral — a theory that says that workers bargain for wage increase as inflation rises, fueling higher demand and pushing companies to raise prices to compensate for steeper expenses. This in turn leaves workers requiring higher wages to afford goods and services — perpetuating so-called \"second-round effects.\"\\nThe U.K. inflation rate surprised economists by holding above 10% in March. Core inflation, excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, was steady on the previous month at 5.7%.\\nBailey said that the loosening of the labor market, as vacancies begin to fall, is happening more slowly than the central bank previously anticipated.\\nHe noted that nominal wage growth — not adjusted for inflation — and services price inflation had occurred in line with the bank\\'s forecasts. The Bank of England sees signs of a slowdown in wage growth, but observes that services inflation remains elevated, Bailey added.\\nThe bank\\'s monetary policy committee \"continues to judge that the risks to inflation are skewed significantly to the upside,\" he said, and would keep adjusting its main bank rate \"as necessary\" to reach its 2% inflation target.\\nBailey incurred backlash in February last year, when he said that businesses should show \"restraint\" in pay negotiations, and that \"broadly\" workers should not ask for big pay rises. His comments were at the time slammed as out of touch, as the public faced a growing cost-of-living crisis, with inflation creating sharp falls in wage growth in real terms.\\nEconomists and policymakers in the EU and U.S. have said in recent months that they no longer see significant risks of a wage-price spiral in those economies, with salaries having room to rise to catch up with inflation and historic stagnation.\\nMany also say there are signs that companies have been raising prices above their input price inflation, which has protected corporate profit margins.\\nAlberto Gallo, chief investment officer at Andromeda Capital Management, previously told CNBC that the U.K. was the developed economy most at risk from a wage-price spiral because of factors including weakness in the British pound, reliance on food and energy imports and a tight labor market constrained by post-Brexit rules.\\nHuw Pill, Bank of England chief economist, sparked a similar furore last month, when he said on a podcast that there was a reluctance in Britain to accept that \"we\\'re all worse off, we all have to take our share,\" and that workers and companies needed to stop passing price rises on to each other.\\n\"If what you\\'re buying has gone up a lot relative to what you\\'re selling, you\\'re going to be worse off,\" Pill said.\\n\"So somehow in the U.K., someone needs to accept that they\\'re worse off and stop trying to maintain their real spending power by bidding up prices, whether higher wages or passing energy costs through on to customers.\"\\nAddressing the backlash, Pill said in comments quoted by Reuters earlier this week that he would \"probably use somewhat different words.\"\\nNevertheless, he continued, \"I appreciate this is a little bit of a tough message, but ... having to pay more for what we\\'re buying from the rest of the world relative to what we\\'re selling to the world is a squeeze on our spending power.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'A U.S. recession may prevent a steep market downturn in the second half of 2023, according to Michael Yoshikami, founder and CEO of Destination Wealth Management.\\nU.S. consumer price inflation eased to 4.9% year on year in April, its lowest annual pace since April 2021. Markets took the new data from the Labor Department earlier this month as a sign that the Federal Reserve\\'s efforts to curb inflation are finally bearing fruit.\\nThe headline consumer price index has cooled significantly since its peak above 9% in June 2022, but remains well over the Fed\\'s 2% target. The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 5.5% annually in April, amid a resilient economy and persistently tight labor market.\\nThe Fed has consistently reiterated its commitment to fight inflation, but minutes from the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed officials were divided over where to go on interest rates. They eventually opted for another 25 basis point increase at the time, taking the target fed funds rate to between 5% and 5.25%.\\nChairman Jerome Powell hinted that a pause in the hiking cycle is likely at the FOMC\\'s June meeting, but some members still see the need for additional rises, while others anticipate a slowdown in growth will remove the need for further tightening. The central bank has lifted rates 10 times for a total of 5 percentage points since March 2022.\\nDespite this, the market is pricing cuts by the end of the year, according to CME Group\\'s FedWatch tool, which puts an almost 35% probability on the target rate ending the year in the 4.75%-5% range.\\nBy November 2024, the market is pricing a 24.5% probability — the top of the bell curve distribution — that the target rate is cut to the 2.75%-3% range.\\nSpeaking to CNBC\\'s \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday, Yoshikami said the only way that happens is in the event of a prolonged recession, which he said is unlikely without more policy tightening as falling oil prices further stimulate economic activity.\\n\"This is going to sound crazy, but if we don\\'t go into slower economic growth in the United States and maybe even a shallow recession, that might be actually considered a negative because interest rates might not be cut or might even continue to go up if that\\'s the case. That\\'s the risk for the market,\" he said.\\nYoshikami believes more companies are going to begin guiding the market more conservatively on forward earnings in anticipation of borrowing costs staying higher for longer and squeezing margins.\\n\"To me, it all really is going to come down to \\'is the economy gonna touch near a recession?\\' Believe it or not, if that happens, I think it will be good news,\" he said.\\n\"If the economy avoids it and keeps on its frothy path, then I think we\\'re going to have some problems in the market in the second part of the year.\"\\nFederal Reserve officials, including St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, have in recent weeks indicated that sticky core inflation may keep monetary policy tighter for longer, and could require more hikes this year.\\nYoshikami said the actual process of cutting rates would be a \"drastic move\" despite market pricing and suggested policymakers may try to \"massage\" market expectations in a certain direction through speeches and public declarations, rather than definitive policy action in the near term.\\nAs a result of the tenuous path for monetary policy and the U.S. economy, the veteran strategist warned investors to \"be skeptical\" of valuations in certain portions of the market, particularly tech and artificial intelligence.\\n\"Think about it, look at it yourself and ask yourself this question: is this a reasonable stock given what we think the earnings are going to be for the next five years? If it\\'s not, you\\'re putting an optimism premium on that asset that you better be awfully sure about because that\\'s where, really, tears come,\" he said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'WASHINGTON — Former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, who guided the central bank and the U.S. economy through the Great Recession, thinks central bankers still have work to do to bring down inflation.\\nThat work, he and economist Olivier Blanchard argue in an academic paper released Tuesday, will entail slowing down what has been a phenomenally resilient labor market.\\nThe duo does not present specific prescriptions for how much unemployment needs to rise, but they do suggest it\\'s possible for the current Fed to orchestrate its way out of this predicament without severely tanking the U.S. economy.\\n\"Looking forward, with labor market slack still below sustainable levels and inflation expectations modestly higher, we conclude that the Fed is unlikely to be able to avoid slowing the economy to return inflation to target,\" Bernanke and Blanchard wrote in the paper.\\nSince leaving the Fed in 2014, Bernanke has been a distinguished senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Blanchard is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\\nTheir paper notes that inflation has evolved since ballooning to a 40-year high in the summer of 2022. Initially, prices jumped as consumers used stimulus from Congress and the central bank to shift spending from services to goods, creating logjams in supplies and juicing inflation.\\nHowever, they note the new phase is now being pushed by a rise in wages trying to catch up to the surge in prices. The good news is that such shocks are generally controllable, but they said the Fed needs to keep trying to address the labor situation in which the unemployment rate is at 3.4% and there are still about 1.6 open jobs for every available worker.\\n\"The portion of inflation which traces its origin to overheating of labor markets can only be reversed by policy actions that bring labor demand and supply into better balance,\" Bernanke and Blanchard say.\\nThe paper, though, is as much about what caused a surge that took headline inflation as gauged by the consumer price index above 9% last year as it is what happens from here.\\nMost economists agree that a combination of trillions in government spending combined with zero interest rates and nearly $5 trillion in bond purchases from the Fed flooded the economy with money and created distortions that led to soaring prices.\\nIn a forum Tuesday presented by the Brookings Institution, Bernanke, Blanchard and other high-profile economists and academics discussed the root causes and what policymakers should do as they review policies for the future.\\nAmong the considerations were the factors of supply and demand, how much Covid itself influenced consumer decisions, and whether a new policy framework the Fed adopted in September 2020 that sought not only employment that was full but also \"broad-based and inclusive\" played a role in the economic dynamics.\\n\"The quantitatively larger sin was fiscal policy, especially for the year 2021. The less forgivable sin, though, was monetary policy,\" said Jason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and now an economics professor at Harvard.\\n\"I have lower expectations for fiscal policy. When they get the sign right, I\\'m pleasantly surprised,\" he added. \"Monetary policy made the error again and again and meeting after meeting. … I do have higher expectations for the Fed than just getting the sign right.\"\\nAs inflation rose past the Fed\\'s 2% target, policymakers persisted in calling the trend \"transitory\" and did little other than to begin discussing when it would reduce its bond purchases. The Fed only began raising interest rates in March 2022, a full year after its preferred inflation gauge eclipsed the target.\\nSince then, policymakers have raised benchmark interest rate 10 times for a total of 5 percentage points, taking the fed funds rate to its highest level in nearly 16 years.\\nFormer Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, who was on the Federal Open Market Committee during the inflationary surge, said the missteps on policy were not attributable to an over-adherence to the policy framework adopted in 2020, which came amid racial unrest across the country. He called the Fed\\'s hesitance to tighten policy \"an error of tactics and not of strategy\" and attributed it to the \"fog of war.\"\\nHe also noted the Fed was hardly alone: Many other global central banks chose not to raise rates amid the inflation spike.\\n\"No advanced economy central bank began to hike rates until inflation exceeded target,\" Clarida said. \"Why this happened, obviously, is a very important and interesting question that says more about the practice of inflation-targeting central banking in the sphere than it does about any particular implementation of a framework.\"\\nThe Bernanke-Blanchard paper notes the danger inherent in central banks letting inflation go on for too long and the impact that has on expectations for prices.\\n\"The longer the overheating episode, the stronger the catch-up effect, and the weaker the anchoring of expectations, the larger is the effect of labor market tightness on inflation, and, implicitly, the stronger the eventual monetary contraction needed to return inflation to target, all else equal,\" they wrote.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nA blockbuster profit report Wednesday from Nvidia crystallized an important point for both markets and the economy: For better or worse, artificial intelligence is the future.\\nWhether it\\'s personalized shopping, self-driving cars or a broad array of robotics uses for health care, gaming and finance, AI will become a factor in virtually everyone\\'s lives.\\nNvidia\\'s massive fiscal first-quarter earnings helped quantify the phenomenon as the firm nears an elite cast of tech leaders with $1 trillion market valuations and clear leadership status both on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley.\\n\"AI is real, AI is not a fad and we\\'re only in the early innings,\" said Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard. \"Does it change the course of the economy over the next three to six months? Probably not. Does it change the economy over the course of the next three to six years? Absolutely, and in very interesting ways.\"\\nSome of the changes Blitz foresees are reduced demand for foreign labor, a \"point of sale\" effect where coding and creative writing can be done by machines instead of people and a host of other activities that go beyond what appears obvious now.\\nDevelopment of products such as OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT, a chatbot that converses with the user, has helped bring home the potential.\\n\"It\\'s hard for me to overstate the value or the impact of AI, and it is in keeping with my view that this coming decade is all about the broader application of technology beyond what we\\'ve seen to date, beyond computers and phones, and that application has tremendous upside,\" Blitz said.\\nFor Nvidia, the upside already has been apparent.\\nAs if profit of $1.09 a share on revenue of $7.19 billion, both well above Wall Street estimates, wasn\\'t enough, the company guided it was expecting $11 billion in sales for the current quarter, largely driven by its leadership position in the AI chip-supplying business.\\nShares soared more than 26% higher around midday Thursday and the company\\'s market value surpassed $950 billion.\\nBroader market reaction, however, was underwhelming.\\nWhile the S&P 500 semiconductor index jumped 11.4%, the broader Nasdaq Composite rose a more muted 1.7%. The S&P 500 was up about 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped more than 50 points as investors continued to fret over the debt ceiling negotiations in Washington.\\nAt the same time, worries of an economic slowdown persisted — despite his excitement over AI, Blitz still thinks the U.S. is headed for recession — and the lopsided market reaction served as a reminder of a stratified economy in which technological benefits tend to spread slowly.\\n\"The spillover and the benefits that the rest of the economy will derive from AI is a multiyear, multidecade process,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. \"Is this an incremental piece to growth or is this now diverting spending from other things because every other part of the economy, outside of spending on travel, leisure and restaurants, doesn\\'t seem to be going that well?\"\\nBoockvar pointed out small-cap stocks, for instance, were losing big Thursday, with the Russell 2000 off about 0.8% in early afternoon trading.\\nThat happened even though it seems those companies would benefit from the cost-saving aspects of AI such as the ability to reduce staffing expenses. Nvidia\\'s chief competitor in the chip space, Intel, also was getting slammed, down 6.2% on the session. Quarterly tech earnings overall declined 10.4% heading into this week, according to FactSet, though some of the biggest firms did beat Wall Street\\'s lowered expectations.\\n\"There are some serious holes in the economy that we can\\'t ignore here,\" Boockvar said. \"If the AI craze cools, people will see that the underlying business trends of Microsoft, Google and Amazon are clearly slowing because we all breathe the same economic air.\"\\nAI hasn\\'t been a winner for everyone, either.\\nDataTrek Research looked at nine big AI-related companies that came to market through initial public offerings over the past three years and found their collective valuation is down 74% from their debut levels.\\nThe group includes UiPath, Pagaya Technologies and Exscientia. Their stocks have rallied in 2023, up an average 41%, but the seven-largest tech companies, a group that includes Nvidia, have surged an average 58%.\\n\"So far, Big Tech has collectively benefited most from the buzz around gen AI. We think this trend will continue given their ability to leverage their global scale and large competitive moats when utilizing this disruptive technology,\" DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote. \"Gen AI may end up making US Big Tech even bigger and more systematically important, rather than allowing upstarts to play the classic role of disruptive innovators.\"\\nIndeed, market veteran Art Cashin noted without the big seven stocks, the S&P 500 would surrender all of its 8% gain this year.\\n\"You know, supposedly, the high tide lifts all boats,\" the director of floor operations for UBS said on CNBC\\'s \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"This is a very selective tide. And I\\'m not ready to throw out the confetti yet.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Inflation stayed stubbornly high in April, potentially reinforcing the chances that interest rates could stay higher for longer, according to a gauge released Friday that the Federal Reserve follows closely.\\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, which measures a variety of goods and services and adjusts for changes in consumer behavior, rose 0.4% for the month excluding food and energy costs, higher than the 0.3% Dow Jones estimate.\\nOn an annual basis, the gauge increased 4.7%, 0.1 percentage point higher than expected, the Commerce Department reported.\\nIncluding food and energy, headline PCE also rose 0.4% and was up 4.4% from a year ago, higher than the 4.2% rate in March.\\nDespite the higher inflation rate, consumer spending held up well as personal income increased.\\nThe report showed that spending jumped 0.8% for the month, while personal income accelerated 0.4%. Both numbers were expected to increase 0.4%.\\nPrice increases were spread almost evenly, with goods rising 0.3% and services up 0.4%. Food prices fell less than 0.1% while energy prices increased 0.7%. On an annual basis, goods prices increased 2.1% and services rose by 5.5%, a further indication that the U.S. was tilting back toward a services-focused economy.\\nFood prices rose 6.9% from a year ago while energy fell 6.3%. Both monthly PCE gains were the most since January.\\nMarkets reacted little to the news, with stock market futures pointing higher as investors focused on improving prospects for a debt ceiling deal in Washington. Treasury yields were mostly higher.\\n\"With today\\'s hotter-than-expected PCE report, the Fed\\'s summer vacation may need to be cut short as consumers\\' vacations fuel spending,\" noted George Mateyo, chief investment officer at Key Private Bank. \"Prior to today\\'s release, we believe that the Fed may have been hoping to take the summer off (i.e., pause and reassess), but now, it seems as if the Fed\\'s job of getting inflation down is not over.\"\\nThe report comes just a few weeks ahead of the Fed\\'s policy meeting June 13-14.\\nThe Fed targets annual inflation around 2%, meaning that the current levels remain well above the goal and leading to the likelihood that the aggressive moves the central bank has made over the last year or so could remain intact.\\nOne way the Fed\\'s rate hikes are supposed to work is by bringing down demand. The April spending numbers, however, show that consumers have continued spending in the face of both higher rates and strong inflation, meaning policymakers may have more to do.\\nImmediately following the report, market pricing swung to a 56% chance that the Fed will enact another quarter percentage point interest rate hike at the June meeting, according to the CME Group. There are only two key inflation-related data points before then, with the May nonfarm payrolls report due next Friday and the consumer price index out June 13.\\nAlong with the uptick in consumer spending, demand for durable goods also unexpectedly increased 1.1% in April, according to a separate Commerce Department report. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a decline of 0.8%. Excluding transportation, which increased 3.7%, new orders fell 0.2%.\\nConsumers had to dip into savings to keep up their spending, with the personal savings rate of 4.1% representing a 0.4 percentage point drop from March.\\nThe data comes amid a high level of uncertainty about where the economy heads from here. Expectations for a recession later this year are high, considering rising interest rates, an expected credit crunch in the banking industry and consumer pressure on a variety of fronts.\\nHowever, a report Thursday showed the economy grew more in the first quarter than initially reported, with real GDP rising at a 1.3% annualized pace compared with the previous estimate of 1.1%.\\nReal gross domestic income, however, fell 2.3% in the quarter. GDI measures all money earned for goods and services and usually moves in conjunction with GDP. Averaging the two measures shows a quarterly growth decline of 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department.\\nAt the same time, the goods trade deficit soared 17% in April to $96.8 billion, according to Commerce\\'s advanced economic indicators report released Friday. Exports are a net negative for GDP.\\nStill, Citigroup economists expect the Fed to raise its forecasts for inflation and GDP when it releases its updates at the June meeting.\\nMinutes released Wednesday from the May Fed meeting showed policymakers split on their next move, as members sought to balance higher-than-expected inflation against the spillover effects from troubles in the banking industry.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'The U.S. labor market posted another month of surprising strength in May as companies added jobs at a pace well above expectations, according to a report Thursday from payroll processing firm ADP.\\nPrivate sector employment increased by a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the month, ahead of the Dow Jones estimate for 180,000 and a bit lower than the downwardly revised 291,000 in April. May\\'s increase took the payroll growth so far in 2023 to 1.09 million.\\nThe ADP report noted that the distribution of job gains was \"fragmented\" for the month, as increases were concentrated in leisure and hospitality, which added 208,000 positions, and natural resources and mining, which saw a gain of 94,000.\\nConstruction added 64,000 jobs, but multiple other categories had declines.\\nFor instance, manufacturing saw a drop of 48,000, financial activities lost 35,000, and education and health services was off by 29,000. Trade, transportation and utilities posted an increase of 32,000 while the other services category added 12,000.\\nFrom a size perspective, companies with 500 or more workers lost 106,000 jobs. Small firms, with fewer than 50 workers, added 235,000 positions.\\nOne area of note for ADP was a slowdown in the pace of wage gains, with annual pay up a still-robust 6.5% in May but down from the 6.7% increase in April. Those switching jobs reported an annual increase of 12.1%, off a percentage point from the month before.\\n\"This is the second month we\\'ve seen a full percentage point decline in pay growth for job changers,\" Nela Richardson, ADP\\'s chief economist said. \"Pay growth is slowing substantially, and wage-driven inflation may be less of a concern for the economy despite robust hiring.\"\\nThe ADP count comes a day ahead of the Labor Department\\'s more closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show job growth of 190,000 in May following a gain of 253,000 in April.\\nADP\\'s report serves as a precursor to the government\\'s tally, though the two sometimes can differ considerably. The Labor Department said private payrolls rose by 230,000 in April.\\nThe payroll gains have come despite the Federal Reserve\\'s efforts to tackle inflation and slow the labor market through a series of interest rate increases. Central bank officials have said in recent days that they may be in favor of skipping another hike in June as they weigh the impact of policy tightening that began in March 2022.\\nA separate report Thursday showed that initial filings for unemployment benefits were little changed last week.\\nJobless claims totaled 232,000 for the week ended May 27, up 2,000 from the previous week and slightly below the Dow Jones estimate for 235,000. Continuing claims edged higher as well to 1.795 million.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Watching the monthly jobs reports this year has been something of a waiting exercise, with economists and market participants looking for a downturn that never seems to arrive.\\nThat scenario is likely to recur Friday when the Labor Department releases its nonfarm payrolls count for May. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect job growth of 190,000, a slowdown from the 253,000 jobs added in April, below the 2023 monthly average of 284,500 and the lowest monthly gain since December 2020.\\nBut judging by the way these reports have been going, the risk is probably to the upside in a jobs market that has been nothing if not resilient. The jobs count has beaten consensus estimates 13 of 16 times since January 2022.\\n\"The labor market still looks tight. Job openings are very high, unemployment is at a 50-plus-year low. We\\'re expecting further job gains... actually a bit above consensus,\" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities America. \"I would tell people to focus on whatever the trend is.\"\\nFor how much the headline numbers have been defying the market outlook, LaVorgna sees some underlying weakness.\\nTotal job openings edged higher in April to 10.1 million, but the pivotal leisure and hospitality industry actually registered a nearly 6% decline, according to Labor Department data released Wednesday. That could be bad news for a sector that has generated more than 900,000 jobs over the past year.\\nAlso, the April nonfarm payrolls report showed that job growth estimates for the prior two months were cut by 149,000, indicating that the picture from earlier this year hadn\\'t been quite as robust as initially indicated.\\n\"Right now, we\\'re getting close to an inflection point,\" said LaVorgna, who was chief economist for the National Economic Council under former President Donald Trump. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to happen in May, but given the amount of tightening in the economy that the Fed has engineered and given that lending standards have gotten more restrictive, the labor market should weaken. History tells us when it happens, it happens fast.\"\\nThe tight labor market and the pressure that has put on wages and inflation has bedeviled the Federal Reserve. The central bank has raised interest rates 10 times since March 22, only to see inflation stay well above the Fed\\'s 2% target.\\nPolicymakers, though, have signaled that they may be willing to skip hiking again when they meet later in June, as they look to see how all the policy tightening has impacted conditions.\\n\"A decision to hold our policy rate constant at a coming meeting should not be interpreted to mean that we have reached the peak rate for this cycle,\" Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said in a speech Wednesday. \"Indeed, skipping a rate hike at a coming meeting would allow the [rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee] to see more data before making decisions about the extent of additional policy firming.\"\\nOne area policymakers will be focused on is average hourly earnings.\\nWages are expected to increase 0.3% for the month and 4.4% from a year ago, a level that officials have said is not consistent with a return to 2% inflation. However, May could bring some good news in that regard.\\nData from Homebase indicates wages for small- and medium-sized businesses declined 0.2% in May, the first monthly decline since 2021. That came even with a 0.64% increase in employees working and a 1.16% gain in hours worked.\\nPayrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday that wages for workers who stayed at their jobs increased 6.5% in May, still high but a deceleration from previous months. ADP also said private payrolls expanded by a higher-than-expected 278,000 in May.\\nA Fed report Wednesday noted that wages grew \"modestly\" which was in line with the rest of the observations the \"Beige Book\" had about the jobs economy.\\n\"Overall, the labor market continued to be strong, with contacts reporting difficulty finding workers across a wide range of skill levels and industries,\" the report said, noting that some employers said \"they were fully staffed, and some reported they were pausing hiring or reducing headcounts due to weaker actual or prospective demand or to greater uncertainty about the economic outlook.\"\\nThe unemployment rate in May was expected to nudge higher to 3.5%, which would still be near the lowest level since 1969.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'The U.S. economy continued to crank out jobs in May, with nonfarm payrolls surging more than expected despite multiple headwinds, the Labor Department reported Friday.\\nPayrolls in the public and private sector increased by 339,000 for the month, better than the 190,000 Dow Jones estimate and marking the 29th straight month of positive job growth.\\nThe unemployment rate rose to 3.7% in May against the estimate for 3.5%, even though the labor force participation rate was unchanged. The jobless rate was the highest since October 2022, though still near the lowest since 1969.\\nAverage hourly earnings, a key inflation indicator, rose 0.3% for the month, which was in line with expectations. On an annual basis, wages increased 4.3%, which was 0.1 percentage point below the estimate. The average workweek fell by 0.1 hour to 34.3 hours.\\nMarkets reacted positively after the report, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 400 points in early trading. Treasury yields rose as well as markets digested both the strong jobs numbers and a debt deal in Congress.\\n\"The U.S. labor market continues to demonstrate grit amid chaos – from inflation to high-profile layoffs and rising gas prices,\" said Becky Frankiewicz, president and chief commercial officer of Manpower Group. \"With 339,000 job openings, we\\'re still rewriting the rule book and the U.S. labor market continues to defy historical definitions.\"\\nMay\\'s hiring jump was almost exactly in line with the 12-month average of 341,000 in a job market that has held up remarkably well in an economy that has been slowing.\\nProfessional and business services led job creation for the month with a net 64,000 new hires. Government helped boost the numbers with an addition of 56,000 jobs, while health care contributed 52,000.\\nOther notable gainers included leisure and hospitality (48,000), construction (25,000), and transportation and warehousing (24,000).\\nDespite the big jobs gain, the unemployment rate increased due in large part to a sharp decline of 369,000 in self-employment. That was part of an overall drop of 310,000 counted as employed in the household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate and generally is considered more volatile than the survey of establishments used for the headline payrolls number.\\n\"The upshot is that the only genuine sign of weakness in the report was the decline in average weekly hours worked to 34.3, from 34.4, which left them at the lowest level since the Covid nadir in April 2020,\" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist for Capital Economics.\\nAn alternative measure of unemployment that encompasses discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons edged higher to 6.7%.\\nMay\\'s jobs numbers come amid a challenging time for the economy, with many experts still expecting a recession later this year or early in 2024.\\nRecent data has shown that consumers continue to spend, though they are dipping into savings and increasingly using credit cards to pay for their purchases. A resilient labor market also has helped underpin spending, with job openings rising back above 10 million in April as employers still find it difficult to fill open positions.\\nOne major potential headache appears to have been eliminated, as warring factions in Washington this week have reached a debt ceiling deal. The agreement is on its way to President Joe Biden\\'s desk for a signature following passage in the House and Senate this week.\\nThere remain other issues ahead, though.\\nThe Federal Reserve has raised benchmark interest rates 10 times since March 2022 in an effort to fight inflation that hasn\\'t gone away. In recent days, some policymakers have indicated a willingness to take a break in June from the succession of hikes as they look to see what impact the policy tightening is having on the economy.\\nHowever, odds for a June rate hike rose after the jobs report. Traders briefly priced in about a 38% chance of another quarter-point increase before the probability fell back to about 26%, according to CME Group data.\\nOther data points have shown that the manufacturing sector of the economy is in contraction, though the much larger services sector has held in expansion. The ISM manufacturing index released Thursday also showed that prices are pulling back, a positive sign for the Fed.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'The U.S. unemployment rate rose in May, but declined for Hispanic workers, according to the latest nonfarm payrolls report.\\nThe overall unemployment rate last month was 3.7%, a gain of 0.3 percentage points from the prior month. However, Hispanic or Latina women saw their unemployment rate fall to 3.4% last month, down 0.7 percentage points from 4.1% in April, the U.S. Department of Labor reported Friday. The unemployment rate for Hispanic men ticked lower to 4% from 4.1% in April. Overall, the unemployment rate among Latinos decreased to 4% in May from 4.4% in the prior month.\\n\"This is a historic low,\" said Carmen\\xa0Sanchez Cumming, a research associate at the Washington Center for\\xa0Equitable Growth, of the overall decline in the Hispanic unemployment rate. \"The only other time that it\\'s been this level was in November 2022 and September of 2019 … For both Hispanic workers and for Black workers, at least in the first half of 2023, this recovery has been especially strong.\"\\nMeanwhile, unemployment for Black workers overall rose 0.9 percentage points to 5.6% in May from 4.7% in April. Among Black men, the rate was 5.6% in May, compared to 4.5% in April. The unemployment rate also ticked higher for Black women, rising to 5.3% in May from April\\'s rate of 4.4%.\\n\"Economic research and empirical data shows that for Hispanic workers and for Black workers, their outcomes are much more sensitive to fluctuations in the business cycle,\" Cumming said. \"So, when the labor market is really strong, Latino workers and Black workers benefit disproportionately, but when the labor market is weak, Black and Latino workers [are] hurt disproportionately, too.\"\\nThe monthly jobs report is made up of two surveys: the payroll survey of employers and the household survey. There is a lot of volatility on a monthly basis that comes into play when looking at smaller demographic groups in the household survey, Cumming warned.\\nThat volatility is the big story in the May jobs report, said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.\\n\"It\\'s important when we look at something like that to pay attention to the longer-term trend, because every month there can be a lot of movement,\" Gould said.\\n\"The longer-term trend suggests that the Black unemployment rate has been coming down,\" she added. \"So it\\'s about where it was three months ago. Yes, it was lower last month. It ticked up, but I think that probably it will resolve down again next month.\"\\nThe labor force participation rate for the overall population held at 62.6% in May. This metric measures the percentage of people who are either working or actively seeking employment. For Black men, the labor force participation rate ticked up to 68.2%, an increase from 67.8% in April. For Black women, the rate held steady at 63.9%.\\nMeanwhile, the labor force participation rate for Hispanic men was 79.5% in May, up from 78.9% in April. The rate stayed the same for Hispanic women at 61.2%.\\n',\n",

U.S. GDP growth is expected to decelerate in 2024 to 0.8% amid the higher rates.\\nThe bank estimates overall global growth will decelerate to 2.1% in 2023, down from 3.1% last year. Emerging and developing economies are forecast to see a slight uptick in gross domestic product to 4%, up 0.6% from the bank\\'s projections made in January 2023. However, World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill said excluding China, growth in developing economies would be less than 3%.\\nThis marks \"one of the weakest growth rates in the last five decades,\" Gill told reporters Tuesday.\\nThe reduced forecasts for growth reflect broad-based downgrades stemming several overlapping shocks, most recent of which include spillover effects from the recent banking crisis seen in the U.S. and advanced economies. Increasingly restrictive credit conditions resulting from the banking turmoil have effectively shut out emerging and developing economies from global bond markets, putting them \"in dangerous waters,\" said the bank.\\nFiscal weakness has dealt a further blow to low-income countries, 14 out of 28 of which are now in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress, according to the report. One-third of these countries are expected to see per capita incomes in 2024 remain at 2019 levels.\\nNonetheless, central banks around the world continue raising rates to fight off persistent inflation.\\n\"The world economy remains hobbled,\" the bank said in the report. \"Besieged by high inflation, tight global financial markets, and record debt levels, many countries are simply growing poorer.\"\\n',\n",

This pronouncement was adjusted down after Germany also cut its growth figures for the same period, and effectively entered a recession.

The one-year expectation then was 4%; inflation as measured by the consumer price index actually would rise to 8.6% a year later.\\nIn the current case, the survey matches general expectations that while prices are still well above the Fed's 2% annual target, the general trend is lower as some of the Covid pandemic-specific factors such as outsized demand for big-ticket goods and supply chain clogs are easing.\\nStill, median inflation expectations over the longer run edged higher. The three- and five-year outlooks both increased 0.1 percentage point to respective readings of 3% and 2.7%.\\nSome of the inflation rise has been fed by accelerating wages, and the survey showed the outlook there is also diminishing. One-year expected earnings growth fell to 2.8%, down 0.2 percentage point since April and in keeping with the general range since September 2021.\\nThe survey also reflected how resilient the labor market has been.\\nExpectations for losing one's job fell 1.3 percentage points to 10.9%, the lowest since April 2022. The mean likelihood of leaving one's job also fell half a percentage point to 19.1%.\\nThe job market strength has come despite a series of 10 Fed interest rate hikes aimed in large part at correcting a labor imbalance in which there were 1.8 job openings for every available worker in April. Markets largely expect the Fed to skip hiking rates at its meeting this week as policymakers process the impact that their moves have had on economic conditions.\\nThe survey also showed household finances remain solid, with spending expected to increase 5.6% over the next year, up 0.4 percentage point from April but below the 6.7% average over the previous 12 months.\\nCorrection: The three- and five-year outlooks both increased 0.1 percentage point to respective readings of 3% and 2.7%.

During that period, the labor market has shown resilience, with nonfarm payrolls climbing by nearly 1.6 million in 2023.\\nHowever, the May jobs report showed some chinks in the armor, with the unemployment rate rising by 0.3 percentage point to 3.7% as the household survey showed a decline of 310,000 in those saying they are employed.\\nInflation has fallen as the Fed has raised rates but remains well above the central bank\\'s 2% target.\\nThe Fed will get its last look at inflation data ahead of the meeting when the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday releases the consumer price index report for May.

       "    'content': 'Inflation data from May will show that the price increases that have been bedeviling consumers for the past two years are slowing down.\\nThe question, though, will be whether that deceleration will be enough to convince Federal Reserve officials that they can stop raising interest rates and let the U.S. economy breathe on its own for a while.\\nThe consumer price index, set to be released Tuesday at 8:30 a.m ET, is expected to show that all-items inflation increased just 0.1% last month, equating to a 4% annual rate, according to the Dow Jones consensus estimate. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, CPI is forecast to rise 0.4% and 5.3%, respectively.\\nThose kinds of numbers could encourage policymakers that inflation is headed in the right direction, after it peaked above 9% in June 2022.\\n\"The most encouraging thing is the year-over-year growth rates are going to come down pretty sharply,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\\'s Analytics. \"The headline number is going to feel good, it\\'s going to be encouraging, showing inflation is moving in the right direction. More fundamentally, I think inflation is moving in the right direction.\"\\nIndeed, inflation has come a long way since it began surging in the spring of 2021. Pandemic-related factors such as clogged supply chains and outsized demands for goods over services combined with trillions in monetary and fiscal stimulus to send inflation to its highest level since the early 1980s.\\nAfter a year of insisting inflation wouldn\\'t last, the Fed in March 2022 began what would be a series of 10 interest rate hikes. Since then, inflation has been on a gradual descent, but still far away from the central bank\\'s 2% target.\\nTuesday\\'s report is expected to be enough to convince policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee to skip a rate hike at its meeting this week as they await incoming data and decide the longer-term policy trajectory.\\n\"Inflation is coming in and they might get a number that gives them comfort that things are moving in the right direction,\" Zandi said. \"They don\\'t need to raise rates again.\"\\nThere will be several key variables to watch in the May CPI report.\\nOne will be an anomaly: Core inflation likely will look much stronger than headline, an unusual occurrence being that the former takes into account fewer variables and excludes food and energy that tend to run hotter. The discrepancy is largely the result of year-over-year comparisons that will entail a period when gasoline was on its way to over $5 a gallon at the pump, a condition that has since abated.\\nOther parts of the report worth looking at closely are used vehicle prices, which jumped 4.4% on a monthly basis in April and are expected to be high again in May. Shelter costs make up about one-third of the CPI weighting, but Fed officials are counting on them to decline later this year. Economists also are looking for airfare and lodging costs to rebound in May.\\n\"Inflation has been trending downward for the last year,\" said Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \"If this trend continues, the Fed can declare victory and focus on the employment side of its mandate. However, inflation is still well above the Fed\\'s [2%] target, so the question is whether the downward path is continuing or whether we have hit a plateau.\"\\nWhile market expectations are for the Fed to skip a rate hike at its Tuesday-Wednesday meeting, one final increase is considered likely in July before an extended pause that now is projected to last into the early part of 2024, according to a CME Group gauge of trading in the fed funds futures market.\\nThe CPI report, plus another month\\'s worth of data before the Fed\\'s July 25-26 meeting, could go a long way in determining whether the market is correct — or if officials decide they have more work to do.\\n\"Whether or not they can get a soft landing depends on large part on how inflation plays out,\" said Bill English, a former Fed official who is now a finance professor at the Yale School of Management. \"If inflation stays high, they just have to raise rates more. It may be the path for employment and output that\\'s consistent with getting inflation down to 2% in a couple of years is not one that you would like.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'The inflation rate cooled in May to its lowest annual rate in more than two years, likely taking pressure off the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.\\nThe consumer price index, which measures changes in a multitude of goods and services, increased just 0.1% for the month, bringing the annual level down to 4% from 4.9% in April. That 12-month increase was the smallest since March 2021, when inflation was just beginning to rise to what would become the highest in 41 years.\\nExcluding volatile food and energy prices, the picture wasn\\'t as optimistic.\\nSo-called core inflation rose 0.4% on the month and was still up 5.3% from a year ago, indicating that while price pressures have eased somewhat, consumers are still under fire.\\nAll of those numbers were exactly in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimates.\\nA 3.6% slide in energy prices helped keep the CPI gain in check for the month. Food prices rose just 0.2%.\\nHowever, a 0.6% increase in shelter prices was the biggest contributor to the increase for the all-items, or headline, CPI reading. Housing-related costs make up about one-third of the index\\'s weighting.\\nElsewhere, used vehicle prices increased 4.4%, the same as in April, while transportation services were up 0.8%.\\nMarkets showed little reaction to the release, despite its expected prominence in the decision the Federal Reserve will make at this week\\'s meeting regarding interest rates. Stock market futures were slightly positive, though Treasury yields fell sharply.\\nPricing did shift notably in the fed funds market, with traders pricing in a 93% chance the Fed will not raise benchmark rates when its meeting concludes Wednesday.\\n\"The encouraging trend in consumer prices will provide the Fed some leeway to keep rates unchanged this month and if the trend continues, the Fed will not likely hike for the rest of the year,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial.\\nThe tame CPI reading was good news for workers. Average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation rose 0.3% on the month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in a separate release. On an annual basis, real earnings are up 0.2% after running negative for much of the inflation surge that began about two years ago.\\nThe consumer price index report featured a growing discrepancy between the core and headline numbers. The all-items index usually runs ahead of the ex-food and energy measure, but that hasn\\'t been the case lately.\\nThe year-over-year discrepancy between the two measures stems from gas prices that were surging at this time in 2022. Ultimately, prices at the pump would exceed $5 a gallon, which had never happened before in the U.S. Gasoline prices have fallen 19.7% over the past year, Tuesday\\'s BLS report showed.\\nFood prices, however, were still up 6.7% from a year ago, though eggs fell 13.8% in May and are now slightly negative on a 12-month basis after surging in previous months. Shelter prices have risen 8% and transportation services are up 10.2%. Airline fares also have been in retreat, declining 13.4% year over year.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'A few months into her divorce proceedings, Sarita thought it was suspicious that her spouse, who earned $3 million annually, didn\\'t have many assets. After spending half a year on discovery and enlisting the help of a forensic accountant, the New York housewife eventually tracked down 12 bitcoins — then worth half a million dollars — in a previously undisclosed crypto wallet.\\nSarita, who was married for a decade and asked to use a pseudonym to protect herself from retaliation, said she felt blindsided by her husband\\'s cryptocurrency investment.\\n\"I know of bitcoin and things like that. I just didn\\'t know much about it,\" Sarita said. \"It was never even a thought in my mind, because it\\'s not like we were discussing it or making investments together. ... It was definitely a shock.\"\\nThe world of financial infidelity has become increasingly sophisticated, as investors \"hop\" coins across blockchains and sink their cash into metaverse properties. An NBC News poll found that 1 in 5 Americans have invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, with men between the ages of 18 and 49 accounting for the highest share of all demographic groups.\\nCNBC spoke with divorce attorneys from Florida, New York, Texas and California, blockchain forensic investigators, financial advisors, as well as spouses who were either hunting down virtual coins or the crypto holders themselves. Most agree that the law can\\'t keep up with all the new ways that people earn and safeguard digital assets that largely exist outside the reach of centralized intermediaries such as banks.\\nFamily and marital law attorney Kim Nutter said she first dove into the crypto vernacular in 2015 but that the state of Florida, where her practice is based, only recently inserted \"cryptocurrency\" into the standard request for production of documents — a key part of establishing the couple\\'s marital property during the discovery process.\\n\"I really still think the law is trying to catch up with this novel form of currency, even though it\\'s been around for quite a while,\" Nutter said.\\n\"What I find in litigation is because this is so new to all of us, even the most seasoned attorneys — unless you\\'re really going out of your way to study this — educating the court, knowing what to ask for, and finding the right experts, it\\'s much more of a scramble to me than other areas of law which had been around much longer,\" she said.\\nHunting hidden crypto stashes in divorce has created an entirely new job category of forensic investigators. CNBC spoke with several of these crypto hunters, and they say that while the blockchain is a public ledger, some spouses have become very good at covering their financial tracks.\\n\"If you have a spouse that\\'s very tech savvy, and one that isn\\'t, it can be somewhat easy to hide those assets,\" divorce attorney Kelly Burris told CNBC.\\n\"The thing with cryptocurrency is it\\'s not regulated by any kind of centralized bank, so usually you can\\'t subpoena somebody and get documents and information related to somebody\\'s cryptocurrency holdings,\" Burris said. She said she sees explicit cryptocurrency requests in discovery in 40% to 50% of her cases.\\nThe Austin, Texas-based attorney told CNBC that the ideal way to get information on a spouse\\'s crypto holdings is to subpoena that information from a centralized crypto exchange. Otherwise, the process often involves a forensic analysis of their computer or phone to identify a wallet address and then a subsequent blockchain analysis.\\n\"Crypto asset forensics, cryptocurrency forensics, and blockchain forensics have become a significant part of our practice and by far, the fastest growing part of our practice,\" said Nick Himonidis, a New York-based forensic investigator.\\nHimonidis, who is also a licensed private investigator and a computer forensic expert, estimates that 25% of his divorce-related cases involve some elements of cryptocurrency. Some of those cases, he said, are simple and straightforward — situations where, for example, a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin is a custodial asset held in a brokerage account or on a trading platform such as Coinbase.\\n\"These companies keep records just like your broker at Morgan Stanley would keep records of your trades,\" he said.\\nOther cases are what Himonidis describes as the \"whole enchilada.\"\\n\"They\\'re calling us because they want to get us appointed as the neutral forensic cryptocurrency expert to marshal and account for the party\\'s crypto assets and track down any undisclosed crypto assets that one party may have,\" he said.\\nWhen Himonidis first got into hunting crypto, it was all about bitcoin, ether and a handful of other coins. CoinMarketCap now lists more than 24,000 cryptocurrencies, with a collective market cap of $1.1 trillion.\\n\"There\\'s not just a couple of blockchains to worry about anymore. There\\'s hundreds and hundreds of coins out there on their own little independent blockchains,\" he said.\\nOne of the core tenets of bitcoin is that its public ledger, which stores all token transactions in its history, is visible to everyone. But there is a subset of cryptocurrencies known as privacy tokens, which have anonymity features built into them. Coins such as monero, dash and zcash, which operate on their own blockchains, disguise practically all transaction details, including the identity of the sender and recipient, as well as the transaction amount. Himonidis said it is \"virtually impossible\" to trace and de-anonymize transactions in monero.\\nIn one case, Himonidis found around $700,000 worth of monero on a MacBook that turned up in discovery.\\n\"We found something called a command line wallet for monero,\" Himonidis said, describing it as a kind of software wallet. \"You can\\'t find it with the Finder on the Mac. You need to go into a command line prompt to access this wallet — a Bash shell command on a Mac environment.\"\\nMultiple investigators and attorneys told CNBC that they are always on the lookout for any type of crypto — but particularly privacy tokens. There is also special attention paid to any kind of hardware wallet or computing device, which can double as a form of \"cold storage\" for cryptocurrencies.\\nPeople who hold their own cryptocurrency can store it \"hot,\" \"cold\" or some combination of the two. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and allows owners relatively easy access to their coins so they can spend their crypto. The trade-off for convenience is potential exposure to bad actors — and forensic investigators working for divorce attorneys.\\nWith cold storage, the private keys — or the passwords that enable the crypto to be moved out of the wallet — are stored on devices, such as computers, that are not connected to the internet. Thumb drive-size devices, such as a Trezor or Ledger, offer another way to secure crypto tokens cold by safeguarding both the crypto itself and the keys to access it.\\nMark DiMichael, who has been in the forensic accounting field for more than 14 years and is a certified cryptocurrency forensic investigator, described one case to CNBC in which a divorcing couple had a stand-off over a password-protected Ledger device.\\nIn the case, DiMichael said, the husband had a Ledger and then the wife found the device in the house and took it. \"So the wife had the Ledger, but she didn\\'t know the pin number, or password. And the husband — he knew the pin number, but he didn\\'t have the Ledger.\"\\nNeither could access the funds without the cooperation of the other.\\nDiMichael, who said he has tracked down millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency since he began tracing digital assets in 2018, explained that when crypto is stored cold, it may be more difficult to seize but it is still traceable.\\n\"If they\\'re doing on-chain transactions and they move something to cold storage, it\\'s still visible on the blockchain,\" he said.\\nDiMichael told CNBC that in a divorce case if you can at least prove that the crypto is there — or that it hasn\\'t been sold — that\\'s usually sufficient for a judge. If a spouse bought 100 bitcoins on Coinbase, for example, and later transferred the currency off an exchange to a wallet, it\\'s still sitting there and fully visible on the blockchain. A court can then order other remedies to retrieve those funds, according to DiMichael.\\nNew York divorce attorney Sandra Radna told CNBC that right at the beginning of a case, when she serves the summons and complaint for a divorce, she also asks for a preservation of assets — known as the \"automatic orders\" in New York. At this point, Radna said, she singles out computer hard drives in her request, to ensure that nothing will be destroyed. This is key since these devices are what the forensic investigator uses to determine where the assets — both crypto and otherwise — went.\\n\"They go through the hard drive of the computer to look for ticker symbols within emails, which is how they can see what purchases were made,\" Radna said.\\nRadna said she also asks for information such as a spouse\\'s \"public keys,\" which she described as being almost like an account number on the blockchain.\\nCurrently, much of the world runs on something called asymmetric cryptography, in which individuals use a private and public key pair to access things such as email and crypto wallets. A private key is a secure code that grants the owner access to their crypto holdings — whereas the public key is a unique wallet address. With the public key, it is possible to find a full history of every transaction made into or out of that wallet.\\n\"If you have that information, you will be able to see every transaction that they did, and it\\'s something that the attorneys are able to get as part of discovery because it\\'s not giving a private number, a private key,\" Radna said.\\nBill Callahan of the Blockchain Intelligence Group said that with that wallet address, crypto hunters are able to tell the attorney or the attorney\\'s investigator that they should go to a specific exchange to request more information.\\n\"One of the things we\\'re looking for are the on- and off-ramps. We\\'re looking to see how the money came on to the blockchain, where it may be, and then where it\\'s off to,\" Callahan said. He said the flow of funds can also show whether something was purposely hidden through an obfuscation technique such as using a crypto asset mixer.\\nThese so-called mixers are designed to obscure trails of funds by blending someone\\'s tokens with a pool of other individuals\\' assets on the platform. They go beyond traditional crypto platforms in further concealing the identity of the people involved in transactions.\\n\"We can kind of track and trace the flow after the proceedings are over to see if something was purposely hidden,\" Callahan said. \"The blockchain never forgets.\"\\nIn one case, Himonidis said, he had to track around $2.3 million that was emptied out of a Coinbase account within a few months of divorce proceedings commencing. The crypto coins hadn\\'t been cashed out to fiat but instead moved as crypto to addresses outside Coinbase in a series of approximately 14 outbound transfers.\\n\"All of it wound up in two or three different wallets on a foreign exchange — a place like Coinbase, but in a foreign country that does not operate in the U.S. and is not subject to the laws and jurisdiction in the United States,\" Himonidis told CNBC.\\nDiMichael said he has run into similar issues with cases where funds were transferred to a global Binance account, and he was, therefore, unable to subpoena records since the funds were in an untouchable jurisdiction.\\nTracking assets gets especially complicated when investors begin to move their tokens across blockchains.\\nDiMichael said \"chain hopping\" — a person switching from one blockchain to another very quickly — is an increasingly common technique used to throw off investigators.\\nBlockchains have their own native tokens. With ethereum, for example, the token is ether. Developers have built cross-chain bridges to let users send tokens from one chain to another. Transfers of digital assets between chains has helped to expand the crypto market by giving people more ways to pay and transact. Cross-chain bridges are vital to the development of the decentralized finance, or DeFi, space, which is crypto\\'s alternative to the banking system.\\nBut in a divorce case these bridges make it difficult for investigators to follow the trail of tokens.\\nTake the crypto token polka dot, which is trading at around $5.40 and has a market valuation of over $6.3 billion. Because the virtual coin is on its own blockchain, when someone wants to trade it they need to \"wrap it\" in order to buy and sell it on the ethereum blockchain, Himonidis told CNBC. Wrapped tokens are pegged to the value of the original coin but are interoperable with other blockchains.\\n\"If we need to start tracing stuff like that, it gets very complicated,\" said Himonidis. \"When they do coin swaps, now we\\'re jumping — literally jumping — blockchains, trying to trace the funds. It was complicated enough before, and now, it\\'s gotten exponentially more complicated in just the last year or two.\"\\nHimonidis said he and his firm are able to follow funds across blockchains using a tool previously only available to law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service, and financial institutions that need it for their know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering functions.\\nBut even with new search tools, Himonidis described his work as a literal race to try to keep up with the latest in rapidly evolving crypto tech.\\n\"It lends itself very well to people who have figured out how it works and understand what\\'s going on there,\" said Himonidis. \"It\\'s this constant arms race.\"\\nDiMichael agrees, telling CNBC it was \"inevitable\" that these kinds of obfuscation techniques would crop up given the amount of money in the crypto ecosystem now, even in the midst of a down market.\\n\"But it is still coming as a total shock to the so-called non-monied spouses,\" DiMichael said.\\nMany centralized exchanges such as Gemini offer customers the option to stake their tokens in order to earn yield on their digital assets that would otherwise sit idle on the platform. With crypto staking, investors typically vault their crypto assets with a blockchain validator, which verifies the accuracy of transactions on the blockchain. Investors can receive additional crypto tokens as a reward for locking away those assets.\\nIn one of his divorce cases, DiMichael said, the husband disclosed the cryptocurrencies he owned, but he didn\\'t disclose the tokens that were staked.\\n\"The ones that he staked, he wasn\\'t really counting those in his numbers, so I uncovered that through the investigative process,\" DiMichael said. \"Even though this cryptocurrency wasn\\'t in his wallet anymore, he still had rights to it.\"\\nEven when both parties in a divorce are totally above board on discovery, volatility in the crypto market can prove to be a major issue when attorneys try to value a marital estate.\\nNodeBaron, a 36-year-old vascular surgical engineer and veteran who asked to be identified by his Twitter username, said he liquidated his stake in dogecoin for around $5,000 during his divorce. Six months later, his holdings would have been worth close to $1 million.\\n\"The cost to get a divorce was almost like a million-dollar decision,\" he said.\\nDivorce attorney Alexandra Mussallem said that because California, where her practice is based, is a community-property state, she often advises her clients on whether to stay in a particular asset — that is, to take half of a community asset in kind versus seeking a liquidated value.\\n\"With volatile investments, the right strategy for a spouse trying to build a stable asset base will be to seek a cash buyout at market value on crypto holdings,\" said Mussallem, adding that it is a question of managing risk.\\nThe spouse with higher risk tolerance may be eager to cash out their partner and retain the crypto asset, given the heavy fluctuations in the crypto market, she said.\\nBurris, the Texas-based attorney, said that in her first crypto case, around five years ago, the husband wanted to buy the wife out of his crypto holdings — which ultimately proved to be a good decision for him, given the rapid price appreciation in the crypto market since 2020.\\nNew York is an equitable distribution state, meaning that a spouse gets 50% of the marital assets accumulated during the marriage.\\nRadna, the New York divorce attorney, told CNBC that digital assets can be taken in two ways.\\n\"One way is to say, what is the value of that digital asset today, and we divide that up,\" she said, calling the process analogous to stocks. \"You can either take the shares of stock, or you can take the value of that.\"\\nIn an up market, Radna said, spouses typically opt for taking the value of the crypto holdings.\\nValuing and dividing a marital estate can become especially problematic when spouses diversify their crypto portfolio into metaverse properties and non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Despite the NFT market collectively losing nearly $2 trillion since its peak in 2021, blue-chip series such as Bored Ape Yacht Club still have a floor price of more than $80,000.\\n\"You have digital land as NFTs, you have digital artwork as NFTs, you have digital metaverse clothing in NFTs,\" said DiMichael, adding that one of his clients had sold $80 million worth of NFTs.\\nDiMichael, who first spoke with CNBC in 2022, said that if a spouse has a couple of NFTs from a collection like the Bored Ape Yacht Club or Crypto Punks, it could add a couple hundred thousand dollars to the marital estate.\\n\"NFTs are really driving me nuts. How do I find the real expert to value the NFT, which is my obligation for a court of law?\" said Nutter, the Florida divorce attorney, referring to the Daubert standard, a rule that governs the admissibility of expert witness testimony in court. \"It requires more peer reviews, articles, a lot more science and community acceptance, which is challenging when you have something particularly like an NFT.\"\\n\"NFTs are kind of new, and people know what they are, but to find somebody who has the level of expertise that could satisfy a court Daubert challenge and questioning I think is problematic for pretty much everybody,\" she said. \"Doesn\\'t matter what side of the coin you\\'re on.\"\\nRadna, who mostly handles litigated divorces and has been practicing for 30 years, said she specifically looks for digital real estate assets in the metaverse when she requests discovery.\\n\"You think it\\'s not real, but they make real income from it,\" said Radna. \"They can get paid for someone to rent that digital real estate where they can have advertising and a billboard, but it would be in the metaverse.\"\\nIf a spouse owns digital real estate and they\\'re getting rent for it, that would be income and counted in the divorce, according to Radna, who said 20% of her caseload has involved crypto in the last few years.\\n\"It\\'s a whole new world, and people should be aware of it,\" she added.\\nCertified financial planner and analyst Davon Barrett told CNBC that with a traditional asset class, he can just give a divorce agreement to Fidelity, for example, and the company will take care of the split on its own.\\n\"But with cryptocurrency, it\\'s a newer space,\" said Barrett, the lead advisor at Francis Financial in New York. \"It\\'s harder to get customer service on the phone at times, so splitting it becomes a little bit more difficult.\"\\nThe tax implications are another major consideration when choosing how to divide crypto assets.\\nThe IRS treats cryptocurrencies like property, meaning that each time you spend, exchange or sell your tokens, you\\'re logging a taxable event. There\\'s always a difference between how much you paid for your crypto, which is the cost basis, and the market value at the time you spend it. That difference can trigger capital gains taxes.\\n\"There are people who bought bitcoin years ago, so their cost basis was $10,000,\" Barrett said.\\nHe gave a hypothetical where a client would potentially be smarter to keep $500,000 in cash, versus bitcoin, so that their spouse is the one stuck with the gains.\\n\"The government, they may not have gotten it in the past, but Uncle Sam is really good about getting his money,\" Barrett said.\\n\"I think that you have your head in the sand if you don\\'t think that this is something that\\'s here to stay, even if during a down market,\" Radna said.\\n\"Like any other asset, just like the stock market, there\\'s going to be ups and downs. I think the people that are interested in digital assets are going to continue to be interested in digital assets,\" she said. \"When it\\'s a down market, that\\'s when you go shopping.\"\\n',\n",

Now, only bids for the chain\\'s intellectual property, including its trademark and domain, will be accepted, according to people familiar with the matter.\\nThe failed home goods retailer is planning to host a separate auction, potentially Thursday, where buyers can submit bids to keep Buy Buy Baby and its stores running, said the people, who weren\\'t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\\nAn initial winner will likely be chosen during Wednesday\\'s intellectual property auction.

It attracted interest from numerous bidders both before and after its parent company declared bankruptcy. Some prospective buyers considered keeping stores open.\\xa0\\nBut as the auction drew nearer, interest in keeping those stores alive waned and the retailer has struggled to nail down bids in an increasingly uncertain sale process, some of the people said.\\nBidders interested in purchasing Buy Buy Baby and operating its brick-and-mortar stores and online presence would need to purchase the bulk of its 100-plus locations to reach profitability.\\xa0\\nThe expenses behind running the stores, such as leases, overhead costs and salaries, make it difficult to reach profitability if a buyer acquires only a fraction of Buy Buy Baby\\'s doors along with its intellectual property.\\xa0\\n\"There\\'s not a profitable model where you only have 10 stores or 40 stores,\" a person with knowledge of the matter previously told CNBC.\\xa0\\nBed Bath & Beyond did not respond to CNBC\\'s request for comment.\\nA credit bid from pre-bankruptcy lender Sixth Street Partners, which could team up with an e-commerce platform, is considered a top contender, some of the people said.

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nDrugmakers are jockeying to capitalize on the next major innovation coming to the blockbuster weight loss industry: effective, convenient and potentially affordable obesity pills.\\xa0\\nAn estimated 40% of U.S. adults are obese, making a successful pill a massive opportunity.\\nIt\\'s too early to crown a winner, especially since pivotal data from several pharmaceutical companies is slated to come out later this year.\\xa0And there\\'s still the all-important issue of pricing for the major players.\\nBut for now, one experimental oral drug from Eli Lilly appears to have an edge over pills from Novo Nordisk and Pfizer — even though it may not win U.S. approval first.\\xa0\\nAll three manufacturers are developing oral versions of GLP-1s, a class of drug that mimics a hormone produced in the gut to suppress a person\\'s appetite. Novo Nordisk\\'s popular Wegovy and Ozempic treatments, which sparked a weight loss industry gold rush last year, are weekly GLP-1 injections also known as semaglutide.\\nThe pills are easier to manufacture than injections, which come in the form of single-use pens. That means the oral drugs could potentially help alleviate the supply shortages plaguing their injectable counterparts.\\xa0\\nPills are also typically cheaper than injections, though it\\'s unclear if that will be the case with the obesity pills.\\xa0\\nWegovy\\'s list price tops $1,300 per monthly package, and Ozempic\\'s is about $935. Novo Nordisk has a low-dose oral version of semaglutide that has the same list price as Ozempic for a monthly package of 30 tablets. That pill, marketed as Rybelsus, is approved only for Type 2 diabetes.\\nNone of the three drugmakers has provided estimates for how much the new obesity pills would cost.\\xa0\\nNovo Nordisk has one important advantage: The Danish company has already released phase three clinical trial results for its high-dose version of oral semaglutide, which is intended for weight management, and told CNBC it expects to file for Food and Drug Administration approval later this year.\\nEli Lilly is still in the middle of phase three clinical trials on its oral drug, orforglipron, meaning it\\'s likely to hit the market later.\\nStill, analysts are confident in the competitive edge of orforglipron in the long run, especially after Eli Lilly unveiled phase two clinical trial results last week that showcased the drug\\'s strong efficacy profile.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAccording to Eli Lilly\\'s phase two results, overweight or obese patients who took 45 milligrams of orforglipron once a day lost up to 14.7% of their body weight after 36 weeks. That compares with a weight loss of 2.3% for people who received a placebo.\\xa0\\nEli Lilly\\'s results appear consistent with the weight reduction caused by Novo Nordisk\\'s pill, but were achieved over a shorter trial period.\\nOverweight or obese patients who took 50 milligrams of Novo Nordisk\\'s drug once a day saw an average weight loss of 15.1% after 68 weeks, according to phase three clinical trial results released Sunday.\\xa0\\nBank of America analyst Geoff Meacham said in a Sunday research note that Eli Lilly\\'s available orforglipron data \"compares quite favorably\" to Novo Nordisk\\'s oral semaglutide, \"cross trial comparison caveats aside.\"\\xa0\\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen told CNBC that orforglipron could potentially achieve an even greater level of weight loss over a longer trial period.\\xa0\\n\"The more you use these drugs, the more weight loss you\\'ll see until it plateaus, right?\" Chen said. \"So the thought is, if you\\'re getting pretty close to semaglutide\\'s weight loss in almost roughly half the time with orforglipron, you will probably exceed it.\"\\xa0\\nChen said the hope is that orforglipron leads to a reduction similar to that of Eli Lilly\\'s injection tirzepatide, which resulted in weight loss of around 22% after 72 weeks.\\xa0\\nThe company\\'s phase three clinical trials on orforglipron will study the drug over longer time periods.\\xa0\\nAt least for now, analysts say Eli Lilly\\'s pill may also have the upper hand over Pfizer\\'s oral GLP-1, danuglipron, which is still in phase two clinical trials.\\nPatients with Type 2 diabetes who took a 120-milligram version of danuglipron twice a day lost around 10 pounds on average after 16 weeks, according to results from one phase two clinical trial.\\nIt\\'s difficult to compare danuglipron\\'s efficacy with that of other oral GLP-1s due to differing patient populations and the lack of longer-term data on the drug.\\xa0\\nA Pfizer spokesperson told CNBC that the company is still studying the drug in further phase two clinical trials and \"would also look to have longer data\" beyond the 16-week mark in the future.\\xa0\\nWells Fargo analyst Mohit Bansal said in a research note that Pfizer\\'s danuglipron will be challenged to compete in the oral GLP-1 space given Eli Lilly\\'s strong orforglipron data.\\xa0\\nHe added that physicians generally prefer once-daily pills — like orforglipron — over twice-daily drugs such as danuglipron.\\xa0\\nHealth experts seem to agree: \"Patient compliance increases a lot if it\\'s a once-a-day pill, so it\\'s definitely a big advantage. People often end up missing a few times a week if they have to take something twice a day,\" said Dr. John Yoon, an endocrinology professor at UC Davis Health.\\xa0\\nPfizer is developing a once-daily version of danuglipron.\\nThe company on Monday also said it would stop developing another experimental pill, lotiglipron, which Bansal said had been the \"more attractive GLP-1\" in Pfizer\\'s portfolio since it\\'s only taken once a day. Shares of Pfizer fell 5% on Monday following that news.\\nBut Pfizer and Eli Lilly do share one key advantage over Novo Nordisk\\'s oral semaglutide: no dietary restrictions.\\xa0\\nPatients need to take Novo Nordisk\\'s oral semaglutide in the morning on an empty stomach with no more than four ounces of plain water, according to the FDA label for the low-dose, approved version of the drug. They\\'re instructed to wait 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other oral medicines.\\nThat\\'s because Novo Nordisk\\'s oral semaglutide is a peptide medication, which is more difficult for the gut to absorb, according to Dr. Eduardo Grunvald, medical director for UC San Diego\\'s Center for Advanced Weight Management.\\n\"If you take it with food or drink, it just won\\'t get absorbed efficiently,\" Grunvald told CNBC.\\nHe said pills from Eli Lilly and Pfizer are non-peptide GLP-1s, which are absorbed more easily and don\\'t require dietary restrictions.\\xa0\\nCantor Fitzgerald\\'s Chen said market research suggests that those restrictions are a \"big negative for patients,\" making the pills from Eli Lilly and Pfizer convenient alternatives.\\xa0\\nOverall, Eli Lilly\\'s orforglipron appears to be the top contender in the weight loss pill space due to its strong efficacy data and convenience as a once-daily pill without dietary restrictions.\\xa0\\nBut Chen emphasized that the data unveiled later this year could potentially change that: \"Save some room for the new data coming.\"\\xa0\\nFor health experts such as Grunvald, naming a winner in the oral weight loss drug space is less important.\\n\"I think these oral GLP-1s mean having more tools in our toolbox, having more options for different people who might react differently to different medicines,\" he said. \"That\\'s really the future of this all.\"\\n',\n",

In total, the SBA disbursed $400 billion in EIDL funds and $800 billion in Paycheck Protection Program loans during the life of the programs.\\nThe inspector general said an overwhelming number of fraudsters attracted to easy money were able to take advantage of the programs because the SBA eased its internal controls in the rush to distribute assistance to struggling small businesses during the pandemic shutdowns.\\nThe SBA, in a letter included in the report, disputed the inspector general's conclusions. Bailey DeVries, a senior official at the SBA, said the report significantly overestimates the amount fraud in the programs.\\nDeVries said the Trump administration rushed out loans during the first few months of the program but additional fraud controls were introduced in 2021.\\nShe also said the 34% potential fraud rate the inspector general found in the EIDL program is inconsistent with the SBA's current repayment data.\\nSBA figures show that 12% of the loans went to borrowers who are past due, most of whom are likely real businesses that are closed or simply unable to repay, DeVries said. Some 74% of businesses have either fully repaid or begun to repay their loans while 14% are still in the deferment period, she said.\\nThe inspector general office's investigations have led to more than 1,000 indictments, 803 arrests and 529 convictions related to fraud in the loan programs, according to the report. These investigations have led to nearly $30 billion in stolen loans being seized or returned by federal law enforcement agencies.\\nThe inspector general's office is still working on tens of thousands of investigative leads on waste, fraud and abuse in the loan programs, according to the report. Thousands of these investigations are expected to continue for years, the inspector general said.\\nThe Paycheck Protection Program provided guaranteed loans to small businesses, individuals and nonprofits that could be forgiven if the borrower fulfilled certain conditions. The Economic Injury Disaster Loan program provided low-interest, fixed-rate loans to help small businesses and other organizations to help cover their operating expenses.\\nAbout 1.6 million EIDL loans worth $114 billion are either past due, delinquent or in liquidation as of May, according to the report. More than 69,000 of these loans worth $3.2 billion have been written off. And more than 500,000 PPP loans have defaulted\\nThe inspector general's report said nonpayment is often an indictor of loan fraud, though not all loans that are past due, delinquent, or charged off will be fraudulent.\\nRead CNBC's latest health coverage:\\n\",\n",

But the increase did not cut into mortgage demand, as buyers sought newly built homes.\\nTotal mortgage application volume rose 3% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association\\'s seasonally adjusted index. An additional adjustment was made for the Juneteenth holiday.\\nApplications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 3% for the week but were 21% lower year over year. These applications have increased for three straight weeks to the highest level since early May, despite still-high mortgage rates.\\n\"New home sales have been driving purchase activity in recent months as buyers look for options beyond the existing-home market,\" said Joel Kan, MBA\\'s vice president and deputy chief economist, in a release. \"Existing-home sales continued to be held back by a lack of for-sale inventory as many potential sellers are holding on to their lower-rate mortgages.\"\\nSales of newly built homes in May soared 12% compared with April and were 20% higher than May 2022, according to a report Tuesday from the U.S. Census. Builders are driving demand in part by offering incentives, like paying down mortgage rates.\\nLast week the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) increased to 6.75% from 6.73%, with points remaining at 0.64 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment.

Lenders hold jumbo loans on their balance sheets, because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac don\\'t buy loans of that size. Bank credit, especially at community banks, has tightened substantially, resulting in higher rates.\\nApplications to refinance a home loan rose 3% for the week but were 32% lower than the same week one year ago.

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nThe Inform Consumers Act, a new law that aims to curb organized retail theft and the sale of counterfeit and harmful products on online platforms, takes effect Tuesday as more retailers blame theft as a reason for lower profits.\\xa0\\nThe new law requires online marketplaces, such as Amazon and eBay, to verify and share information on third-party sellers that handle a high volume of transactions on their platforms in an effort to deter bad actors from selling stolen or harmful goods.\\nIf the companies fail to get in line, they could face more than $50,000 in fines for each violation.\\nThe bipartisan legislation, which stands for Integrity, Notification and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces, passed in December as part of an omnibus spending bill, more than a year after it was introduced by Reps. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., and Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla.\\n\"The goal of the INFORM Consumers Act is to add more transparency to online transactions and to deter criminals from acquiring stolen, counterfeit, or unsafe items and selling them through those marketplaces,\" the Federal Trade Commission, which will be tasked with enforcing the law along with state attorneys general, said on its website.\\xa0\\n\"The Act also makes sure online marketplace users have a way to report suspicious conduct concerning high-volume third party sellers.\"\\nThe law comes after trade associations and retailers lobbied Congress about an alarming uptick in retail theft that they say was driven by lax regulations governing third-party sellers and verification processes on online platforms. They claim organized crime groups steal merchandise from stores and then resell it on online marketplaces, typically at a lower amount than the sticker price.\\nMany experts say organized retail theft has grown alongside the rise of online shopping, which boomed during the Covid pandemic and became the primary way consumers shopped.\\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, e-commerce sales in the U.S. accounted for 16.1% of total retail sales and reached $211.5 billion, a 44.5% increase from the prior-year period, according to Census data. E-commerce growth in the U.S. has since leveled out, but its share of sales has remained consistent.\\nIn the first quarter of 2023, e-commerce in the U.S. accounted for 15.1% of total retail sales, and reached $272.6 billion, a 7.8% jump from the year-ago period.\\nWhile stolen or counterfeit goods make up a small fraction of those transactions, retail groups and law enforcement officials have increasingly called on legislators to address the problem. They\\'ve said it\\'s been difficult to catch bad actors who sell stolen goods online because their identities were shielded.\\nCriminals have been able to operate with \"complete anonymity using fake screen names and fake addresses,\" but the Inform Act will change that, Lisa LaBruno, senior executive vice president of retail operations at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, told CNBC.\\n\"Under INFORM, online marketplaces can no longer turn a blind eye to criminal actors using their platforms to sell stolen and counterfeit goods. The FTC and state attorneys general will be empowered to hold these platforms accountable, and consumers will also have their own reporting mechanism to flag suspicious activity,\" said LaBruno. \"For retailers, INFORM\\'s implementation means we have more support and partners in the fight against organized retail crime.\"\\nWhen the bill was first introduced, it faced criticism for being overly broad and burdensome to small businesses. In a December blog post, eBay said it spearheaded efforts to modify the bill so it strikes \"an appropriate balance to increase transparency and safety for consumers online while also protecting seller privacy.\"\\n\"This compromise legislation avoids a patchwork of state laws and has broad support from consumer groups, retailers, and law enforcement,\" eBay wrote in the post.\\nOnline marketplaces are now required to collect, verify and disclose certain information about third-party sellers that have high transaction volumes on their platforms.\\xa0Many of the online marketplaces subject to the legislation are national, household names. But smaller, more niche platforms with relevant sellers and volume are covered, as well.\\xa0\\nThe rules apply to sellers that had 200 or more separate sales or transactions and $5,000 or more in gross revenue in any continuous 12-month period during the past 24 months, according to the FTC.\\xa0The disclosure requirements are steeper for sellers that have annual gross revenues of $20,000 or more on a particular marketplace.\\nDigital marketplaces will now be required to collect and verify data like contact information, bank account details, tax ID numbers or tax and other government records. The requirements can change based on whether the seller is an individual or corporation, or based on how much business the vendor does on the marketplace.\\nMarketplaces must include that information either in the sellers\\' product listings or in order confirmations, and suspend sellers if they fail to disclose the required information. The marketplaces also have to provide a clear way for consumers to report suspicious conduct on product listings from relevant third-party vendors.\\xa0\\nThe FTC and states will share enforcement authority of the Inform Act.\\xa0\\nMarketplaces found to have run afoul of the law could face civil penalties of $50,120 per violation.\\xa0\\nState attorneys general and other state officials can also file actions in federal court that could result in higher penalties from damages, restitution or other compensation, the FTC said.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s not clear how the law will be enforced, or if the FTC will actively seek out violations or only respond to complaints made through the new reporting systems.\\xa0\\nThe Buy Safe America Coalition, a group that advocates against the sale of stolen or counterfeit goods, sent a letter to the FTC this month urging the agency to \"take immediate action\" once the Inform Act becomes law.\\xa0\\n\"While our respective organizations represent a diverse group of industries and interests, we are singularly united in our belief that INFORM must be fully enforced by the FTC (and the state AGs) to protect consumers and businesses from what has become a serious threat to consumers, honest businesses, and a fair and healthy marketplace,\" the letter, signed by retailers including Gap, Home Depot, Walgreens and Best Buy, states. \"We strongly encourage the FTC to act quickly and publicly to rigorously enforce the law.\"\\nThe group also offered its assistance to the FTC.\\xa0\\nA week before the measure took effect, the FTC sent a letter to 50 online marketplaces about their new obligations under the law and reminded them of the penalties associated with violations.\\nIt urged the groups to communicate the new requirements to the sellers they work with and advise them on how to avoid \"potential imposters\" that could trick them into sharing personal or account information.\\xa0\\n\"The Commission will enforce the Act to the fullest extent possible and will collaborate with our state partners to hold online marketplaces accountable,\" Samuel Levine, the director of the FTC\\'s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.\\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for eBay said the company is \"fully prepared\" to comply with the new law.\\n\"eBay fully supports transparency and is committed to a safe selling and buying experience for our customers,\" the spokesperson said. \"We were proud to support passage of the INFORM Act to create a national standard to protect consumers from bad actors who seek to misuse online marketplaces, while also ensuring important protections for sellers.\"\\nMeta, Facebook\\'s parent company, told CNBC it has already rolled out a business verification tool for shops and sellers that meets the relevant threshold.\\xa0\\nAmazon has notified high-volume sellers that they must verify their information before the law takes effect in order to avoid getting kicked off the platform or having their funds frozen.\\n— Additional reporting by CNBC\\'s Annie Palmer.\\n',\n",

Once the trial results were publicized, Dagar and Bhiwapurkar sold their call options and generated \"significant profits\" totaling more than $350,000, the DOJ said in a release.\\n\"The charges in this case relate to the personal conduct of a former Pfizer employee in violation of the company\\'s policies,\" a Pfizer spokesperson told CNBC. \"Pfizer is cooperating with the government\\'s investigation.\"\\nDagar, 44, of Hillsborough, New Jersey, was arrested Thursday morning and charged with four counts of securities fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, the DOJ said. He was also charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\\nBhiwapurkar, 45, of Milpitas, California, was also arrested early Thursday and charged with two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, according to the DOJ.\\nPatrick Smith, an attorney representing Dagar, said his client denies the allegations and \"looks forward to defending himself in court.\"\\nSmith also said \"nobody at Pfizer ever told\" Dagar the results of the Paxlovid trial.\\nMichael Bachner, an attorney for Bhiwarpukar, said his client denies trading on inside information and based his decisions on publicly available information about the efficacy of the drug.\\nBhiwarpukar \"intends to vigorously defend against these charges,\" according to Bachner.\\nOn Nov. 4, 2021, Dagar learned that a mid-stage Paxlovid trial produced positive results a day before they were scheduled to be made public, the SEC\\'s complaint alleges.\\xa0\\nThe trial found Paxlovid reduced hospitalization or death by 89% compared with placebo in non-hospitalized high-risk adults.\\nDagar\\'s supervisor informed him via chat that the trial \"got the outcome\" and there would be a \"press release tomorrow.\" Dagar responded with \"oh really\" and \"kind of exciting,\" the complaint alleges. \\xa0\\nWithin hours of that exchange, Dagar purchased \"short-term, out-of-the-money\" Pfizer call options. An out-of-the-money call option allows a person to purchase a stock at a price greater than the current market price.\\nPrior to that day, Dagar had never used his brokerage account to trade in Pfizer options and had not traded the company\\'s stock since 2018, the complaint alleges.\\nDagar allegedly shared the successful results with Bhiwapurkar, who purchased similar call options in Pfizer and tipped off another friend who was not named in the complaint.\\nPfizer\\'s stock price jumped nearly 11% after the company released the Paxlovid data on Nov. 5, 2021.\\nDagar, who purchased $8,380 in Pfizer call options, generated a one-day profit of approximately $214,395, the SEC said. That represents an investment return of approximately 2,458%, according to the agency.\\nBhiwapurkar, who purchased $7,400 in call options, generated a one-day profit of approximately $60,300, the SEC said.\\xa0\\nThe unnamed individual who Bhiwapurkar tipped, generated a one-day profit of approximately $29,770, according to the charges.\\n\"As alleged in our complaint, Amit Dagar misused his access to confidential clinical trial results to enrich himself and his friend, Atul Bhiwapurkar,\" Joseph Sansone, chief of the SEC\\'s Market Abuse Unit, said in a release.\\n\"Dagar and Bhiwapurkar allegedly leveraged this information by trading out-of-the-money call options to generate massive one-day returns.

       "    'content': 'The overwhelming majority of people in the U.S. who have tested positive for hepatitis C have not been cured due to the high cost of oral antiviral treatments and obstacles imposed by insurance plans, federal health officials said on Thursday.\\nHepatitis C is often referred to as the silent killer because the initial infection has few to no symptoms. Overtime, however, the virus can cause liver damage, liver cancer, liver failure and ultimately death.\\nThe virus is spread through contact with an infected person\\'s blood, primarily through sharing needles and other equipment used to inject drugs.\\nBreakthrough oral antiviral treatments made by Gilead Sciences and Abbvie have been on the U.S. market for nearly a decade now. These pills, taken once a day for eight to 12 weeks, cure more than 95% of hepatitis C cases.\\nDespite the availability of these medications, only one-third of the 1 million adults in the U.S. who tested positive for hepatitis C between 2013 and 2022 have been cured, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Thursday. Health officials estimate up to another million people in the U.S. are infected but don\\'t know they have the virus.\\nHepatitis C contributed to the deaths of nearly 15,000 people in 2020, according to the CDC.\\n\"Thousands of people are dying every year in our country, and many more are suffering from an infection that has been curable for more than 10 years,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC division that specializes in HIV and viral hepatitis, told reporters on a call Thursday.\\nThe Biden administration has asked Congress to approve $11 billion in funding for a national program to eliminate hepatitis C by 2030. Dr. Francis Collins, who is leading the initiative at the White House, said the program will save thousands of lives and pay for itself by reducing health care costs.\\nRead CNBC\\'s latest health coverage:\\nHealth officials said the primary obstacles to treatment are requirements imposed by health insurance plans and the high cost of treatment. The course of pills can cost up to $24,000 per patient.\\nDr. Carolyn Wester, who heads the CDC\\'s viral hepatitis division, said some health insurers require burdensome preauthorization before patients can receive the pills and also limit which health-care providers can prescribe the medications.\\nCollins, who previously served as director of the National Institutes of Health, said community health centers that treat the uninsured cannot afford the pills for everyone. Only 1 in 4 uninsured adults diagnosed with hepatitis C have been cured, according to the CDC.\\nEven state Medicaid plans impose burdensome requirements such as evidence of liver disease, sobriety and the involvement of specialists, Collins told reporters on Thursday. The high cost of the drugs has made it difficult for Medicaid to treat everyone who is infected, according to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.\\nUnder Biden\\'s proposal, the federal government would pay pharmaceutical companies like Gilead and Abbvie a lump sum for the drugs. The companies would then make the medications available for free to the uninsured, state Medicaid programs, prison systems and people living on Native American reservations.\\nThe proposal is based on a model launched by Louisiana in 2019, in which the state paid Gilead subsidiary Asegua Therapeutics a lump sum for enough drugs over five years to cure nearly all Medicaid patients and people who are incarcerated.\\nCollins said NIH and the Food and Drug Administration are also working on the approval of a rapid hepatitis C test that would provide a diagnosis in an hour or less. The test would be used to diagnose and treat patients in a single visit, he said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nBed Bath & Beyond locations across America will soon be replaced by Burlington Stores outposts and a range of other businesses, after the failed home goods retailer auctioned off its leases as part of its bankruptcy proceedings, court records show.\\xa0\\nThe doomed big-box store selected bidders for 109 of its leases after a Monday auction. Off-price giant Burlington agreed to take over 44 of the locations for $12 million, the largest share of the leases, records filed late Tuesday show.\\xa0\\nBurlington secured six more leases for $1.53 million outside the auction process, bringing the total number of locations to 50 for $13.53 million, records show.\\xa0\\nMany of the locations are considered \"top notch,\" said Bill Read, executive vice president of commercial real estate firm Retail Specialists. Bed Bath\\'s lease auction provided retailers in growth mode an opportunity to snag space in prime locations amid a dearth of quality commercial real estate.\\n\"In aggregate, the Bed Bath & Beyond locations were some of the best that I\\'ve seen become available. They\\'re usually in large community centers with Target as an anchor and multiple other desirable anchor tenants in the shopping center,\" Read told CNBC.\\xa0\\n\"These are generally in well-established, mature markets that have a proven track record of generating high sales,\" he continued.\\nSeveral other retailers snatched up the leases. Here\\'s a list of the top winners:\\xa0\\nThe other winners include grocers, premium furniture stores and discounters. Macy\\'s paid $1.2 million for a lease in ritzy Winter Park, Florida, for a potential Bloomingdale\\'s location, and Barnes & Noble secured a lease in Concord, North Carolina, for $129,015.\\xa0\\nLandlords apart from those companies won 37 of the leases, the next-largest portion after Burlington. Those landlords can now find their own tenants and potentially get a higher rent price than they\\'d be able to within the auction process.\\nThe leases are for both Bed Bath & Beyond and Buy Buy Baby locations. Leases for the Buy Buy Baby outposts could be clawed back depending on what happens at an auction for the chain\\'s assets, Bed Bath & Beyond said in a court filing.\\xa0\\nThe leases sold are for stores that range in size from 14,000 square feet all the way to 92,000 square feet.\\xa0\\nBed Bath & Beyond raked in $24.41 million from the lease auction. A portion of those proceeds will likely go to unpaid rents at the locations and the rest will go to Bed Bath & Beyond to pay the retailer\\'s many creditors.\\xa0\\nWhen Bed Bath & Beyond filed for bankruptcy in late April, the retailer had 468 leases to its name, and 153 of them were brought to auction earlier this week, records show. Successful bids went through for only 109 of them.\\nThe retailer had said in court filings that another wave of lease auctions could take place. It is unclear if that process is underway or what will happen to the additional leases that weren\\'t auctioned off this week.\\xa0\\nThe influx of available stores comes as vacancy rates for shopping centers fell to 5.6% in the first quarter of this year, the lowest level since commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield began tracking in 2007.\\nThe lack of available retail space can hinder companies looking to expand. But retail bankruptcies can provide a unique opportunity to snatch space they couldn\\'t otherwise access.\\nWhen Burlington reported earnings for the three months that ended April 29, the company noted it planned to open 70 to 80 net new stores in fiscal 2023. It aimed to open even more in the coming years.\\xa0\\nDuring a call with analysts, CEO Michael O\\'Sullivan said the company had its eye on \"retail bankruptcies.\"\\n\"We think these bankruptcies are likely to have a significant impact on the availability of attractive new store locations … we\\'re confident that these bankruptcies will strengthen our new store pipeline,\" said O\\'Sullivan.\\xa0\\n\"We hope in 2024 and 2025, some of the availability that we\\'re seeing from retail bankruptcies will give us the opportunity to open more,\" he added.\\nBurlington\\'s decision to buy Bed Bath & Beyond\\'s leases wasn\\'t its first foray into bankruptcy-run lease auctions, the chief executive said on the call.\\xa0\\n\"We have a very strong real estate team that has a lot of experience dealing with retail bankruptcies. Many of our most successful and productive stores today were once upon a time Circuit City, Toys R Us, Sports Authority, Linens \\'N Things,\" said O\\'Sullivan, rattling off a series of other failed retailers that came before Bed Bath & Beyond.\\xa0\\n\"Some of our best stores were created from carved-up Kmart or Sears locations,\" he added.\\nRead, the executive vice president with Retail Specialists, said it\\'s \"no surprise\" Burlington was the top bidder for Bed Bath & Beyond\\'s leases.\\xa0\\n\"Burlington is in aggressive growth mode, these are fantastic locations and they\\'re getting a lot of value for their dollar,\" Read said. \"Companies like Ross and TJX already have enough stores in their fleet that they didn\\'t have to be as aggressive in an auction to get new stores, but it\\'s perfectly reasonable for Burlington to be aggressive to reach their store count desires.\"\\nRead added, \"They\\'re getting reasonable rents, they\\'re getting great locations, they\\'re getting great co-tenancy and they\\'d probably be in a bidding war with other retailers at higher rents for these locations if it was outside of an auction.\"\\n',\n",

They\\'re about to get slimmer.\\xa0\\nThe number of homes for sale this month was actually 7% higher than June of last year, according to Realtor.com. But, in just the last week, that comparison went negative, with the number of homes for sale falling below year-ago levels for the first time in 59 weeks.\\nNew listings in the last week of June were down 29% from the same week a year ago. That\\'s a wider drop than previous weeks.\\nWith mortgage rates surging ever higher, crossing over 7% again on the 30-year fixed Thursday, according to Mortgage News Daily, homeowners have very little incentive to sell their homes. The vast majority of homeowners with mortgages have rates below 4%, with some even below 3%.\\nAn even tighter housing market ahead means home prices are unlikely to cool. Prices peaked last June, after rising over 45% from pre-pandemic levels. They began to fall because mortgage rates had doubled in a matter of months. But prices bottomed in January, according to the latest S&P Case-Shiller home price index, despite still higher interest rates and slower sales.\\n\"The ongoing recovery in home prices is broadly based,\" Craig Lazzara, managing director at S&P DJI, said in a release.\\nPending sales, which measure signed contracts on existing homes, fell nearly 3% in May from April, according to a report Thursday from the National Association of Realtors.\\n\"Despite sluggish pending contract signings, the housing market is resilient with approximately three offers for each listing,\" NAR\\'s chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said in a release. \"The lack of housing inventory continues to prevent housing demand from being fully realized.\"\\nOn the flip side, the nation\\'s homebuilders have been big beneficiaries of the tight market, seeing sales jump 12% in May from April, according to the U.S. Census. Higher mortgage rates have been less of a factor, as builders, some of whom have their own mortgage arms, have been buying down rates for buyers. In May, there were twice as many homes that were sold but hadn\\'t been started as there were a year ago.\\nWhile single-family housing starts are finally increasing, they are still well below historical levels. Builders have also been underbuilding since the great recession, meaning the market was undersupplied well before the recent, pandemic-induced run on housing.\\n\"Bottom line, for all the excitement in the home builders because of the need for more supply, the existing home market is depressed and experiencing a serious case of stagflation with little transactions taking place but at still very high prices,\" wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group.\\n',\n",

That\\'s one effect of diabetes and weight loss drugs, which mimic a hormone produced in the gut called GLP-1 and ultimately suppress a person\\'s appetite.\\xa0\\nDelayed stomach emptying may cause patients undergoing anesthesia to experience nausea, vomiting and aspiration, which is when a person accidentally breathes food into their lungs rather than swallowing it, according to the ASA.\\nThat\\'s why patients are typically required to fast before undergoing anesthesia for procedures.\\xa0\\nThe ASA has received anecdotal reports from across the U.S. that patients taking the drugs during general anesthesia and deep sedation may be at increased risk of those \"serious\" complications, the group\\'s president, Dr. Michael Champeau, said in the guidance.\\xa0\\nOzempic and Wegovy are already associated with side effects like diarrhea and constipation.\\xa0\\nBut Champeau acknowledged that there is still a lack of scientific data on how exactly anesthesia interacts with those drugs, which are also known as GLP-1s.\\xa0\\xa0\\nEach day, about 60,000 people nationwide receive general anesthesia, or medication administered for pain relief during surgeries and other procedures.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s unclear how many people take GLP-1 drugs each day, but their popularity skyrocketed over the last year for being weight loss \"miracles.\" Now, Novo Nordisk\\'s Ozempic and Wegovy are plagued by nationwide shortages.

Factor in marketing costs, which are typically equal to half the production budget, and a swanky premiere and after-party at the Cannes Film Festival, and \"Dial of Destiny\" has quite a hole to dig itself out of.\\nBox office analysts are predicting the film will capture between $60 million and $65 million during its first three days in theaters and around $90 million for the five-day holiday weekend. That would mark the latest mediocre opening in the summer blockbuster season, following disappointing bows for \"The Flash,\" \"Elemental\" and \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" earlier this month.\\nIt would also fall well short of the $100 million \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" secured during its first three days in theaters in 2008. Previous Indiana Jones installments, released in the 1980s, saw significantly lower box office openings because tickets were significantly less expensive at that time and the films were released in fewer theaters.\\nFor instance, \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" was released in more than 4,200 theaters, while 1989\\'s \"The Last Crusade\" was released in 2,300 cinemas, according to Comscore data. In 2023, blockbuster features are generally opening in 4,200 locations, with some films, such as Marvel\\'s \"Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3,\" opening in as many as 4,450 locations.\\n\"Dial of Destiny\" also marks the first time Steven Spielberg hasn\\'t directed an Indy movie, although the musical score was written by franchise stalwart John Williams. James Mangold, who helmed \"Logan\" and \"Ford v Ferrari,\" directed the new one.\\nThe sequel comes 15 years after the \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\" which ended up with a 77% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes but was widely panned by audiences. Despite a solid opening, the fourth Indiana Jones film tallied only $317 million domestically. It did manage to reach $786 million globally, according to data from Comscore.\\nThe lackluster audience response resulted in a pause in future films, including the potential for a spinoff featuring Shia LaBeouf as Indiana Jones\\' son Mutt Williams. In 2012, Disney bought Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion, eventually taking the franchise away from its previous studio partner Paramount Pictures. Disney kept the character on ice while it worked on new Star Wars and Willow content — two other franchises that came from Lucasfilm.\\nNow, in 2023, the fifth installment in the swashbuckling archaeologist\\'s movie adventures has generated a 67% \"Fresh\" score as of Friday morning, with critics saying \"Dial of Destiny\" doesn\\'t quite capture the thrill of earlier adventures. Still, with Ford donning his iconic hat and whip combo, the film gives audiences a nostalgic rush, according to the critical consensus.\\nIt\\'s unclear whether that will result in a ton of ticket sales, however.\\n\"The target audience of men over 35, who grew up on the entire series, will need to show up with their families and, perhaps, introduce the iconic character to their little ones who weren\\'t even around for the previous movie,\" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. \"The franchise has overcome stalled pop culture relevance before, but this time it also has to face that added challenge of winning back viewers who weren\\'t as keen on \\'Crystal Skull\\' as they were for the original films.\"\\nHollywood has had mixed results with nostalgia plays in recent years. While \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" and \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife\" captured healthy box office sales, others have floundered on the big screen. \"Blade Runner 2049,\" \"Independence Day: Resurgence\" and \"Terminator Genisys\" came up short with old fans and new audiences in North America.\\n\"Dial of Destiny\" could benefit from audiences keen to see Ford, who will turn 81 next month, hang up his fedora and potentially even pass off the torch to a new generation.\\nEven with tepid reviews heading into Friday\\'s release, Robbins notes that critics and audiences don\\'t always agree.\\n\"Indiana Jones\\' nature as a traditionally less front-loaded franchise compared to the comic book blockbusters we\\'re used to seeing play with a short fuse also means a sizable portion of its audience could opt to see the film after the initial fan-driven previews and opening day,\" he said.\\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.

The test dictates how much capital banks can return to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. In this year\\'s exam, the banks underwent a \"severe global recession\" with unemployment surging to 10%, a 40% decline in commercial real estate values and a 38% drop in housing prices.\\nAfter they cleared the test, Wells Fargo said it will increase its dividend to 35 cents a share from 30 cents a share, and Morgan Stanley said it would boost its payout to 85 cents a share from 77.5 cents a share.\\nGoldman Sachs announced the largest per share boost among big banks, taking its dividend to $2.75 a share from $2.50 a share.\\nMeanwhile, Citigroup said it would boost its quarterly payout to 53 cents a share from 51 cents a share, the smallest increase among its peers.\\nThat\\'s likely because while JPMorgan and Goldman surprised analysts this week with better-than-expected results that allowed for smaller capital buffers, Citigroup was among banks that saw their buffers increase after the stress test.\\n\"While we would have clearly preferred not to see an increase in our stress capital buffer, these results still demonstrate Citi\\'s financial resilience through all economic environments,\" Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said in her company\\'s release.\\nAll of the big banks held back on announcing specific plans to boost share repurchases. For instance, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley each said they could buy back shares using previously-announced repurchase plans; Wells Fargo said it had the \"capacity to repurchase common stock\" over the next year.\\nAnalysts have said that banks would likely be more conservative with their capital-return plans this year. That\\'s because the finalization of international banking regulations is expected to boost the levels of capital the biggest global firms like JPMorgan would need to maintain.\\nThere are other reasons for banks to hold onto capital: Regional banks may also be held to higher standards as part of regulators\\' response to the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March, and a potential recession could boost future loan losses for the industry.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'By striking down student debt forgiveness Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court not only added a hefty expense back into millions of Americans\\' budgets. It also created the latest challenge for retailers already struggling to predict how consumers may spend in the coming months.\\nThe court\\'s decision squashed President Joe Biden\\'s plan to forgive up to $20,000 per borrower in federal student loan debt. Student loans will already take a bigger bite out of budgets this fall as payments and interest accruals resume after a more than three-year pandemic-related pause. Biden announced steps Friday to make the transition to resuming payments easier and create a path to forgiveness of some loans.\\nThe opinion means outstanding loan balances will be higher as those payments resume than they would have been if the court had ruled in favor of Biden. The plan would have wiped out all debt for nearly 45% of borrowers, or about 20 million people, according to the White House. \\nThe return of payments adds another disruption for the approximately 40 million Americans who have student loans at a time when consumers are showing more caution. Nearly all Americans said they are pulling back on spending in some way, according to a recent CNBC and Morning Consult survey. Retailers, including Walmart,\\xa0Target, Home Depot,\\xa0Kroger and Foot Locker, said customers are buying fewer big-ticket items and switching to lower-priced private-label brands.\\nThe timing of the change could amplify its impact on retailers. Student debt repayment is poised to resume just before the all-important back-to-school and holiday seasons.\\nThe loan changes won\\'t \"make or break if we go into a recession or not,\" said Brad Thomas, a retail analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Yet he said it may have a psychological effect on debt-saddled Americans who are on the hook for hundreds of dollars in monthly payments again.\\n\"It\\'s enough to potentially give us what could be an ugly and disappointing holiday season, relative to expectations,\" he said.\\nLenèe Gill, 31, is one of the borrowers who would have had $20,000 of her loans wiped away. The Denver resident, who works as sales director at a technology company, received Pell Grants to put toward her undergraduate degree at Louisiana State University. Biden\\'s plan would have eliminated her remaining student debt balance.\\nGill said she got a taste of how life without student loans would look during the Covid pandemic. For about three years, she did not pay roughly $400 a month toward her balance. Instead, she saved more money and spruced up the home where she and her fiance live with a new couch, nicer dishes and plants. She chipped away at credit card debt and paid off her car.\\nYet she said she never banked on her debt getting canceled.\\n\"It was always one of those things that I felt was too good to be true,\" Gill said. \"So I never really put a lot of hope or a lot of thought or planning, or even let myself go as far as \\'What would life look like without these payments?\\'\"\\nGill said she\\'ll tighten up the budget as she pays down that debt again. She will likely drop higher-end grocery purchases, such as organic fruits and vegetables and better cuts of meat. Instead of shopping at the farmer\\'s market, she said she will likely buy more at big-box stores like Walmart for cheaper prices.\\nStubborn inflation has forced Americans to pay more for food and housing, and concerns about a potential recession have added to the pressure facing consumers and companies. Meanwhile, government programs like loan relief designed to keep households afloat during the pandemic have fallen by the wayside.\\nStimulus checks, expanded child tax credits and a stronger Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for low-income households all boosted budgets. That cash infusion has ended, even as consumers less wary of Covid have shifted spending toward experiences instead of goods.\\nAll of those factors could hurt retail sales this year.\\nKeyBanc\\'s Thomas said the student loan payment pause was yet another pandemic tail wind for retailers. It could generate an annualized headwind of about 2% to retail sales over the next year if not offset by higher incomes or more borrowing, according to KeyBanc. Many retailers said on earnings calls this spring that smaller tax refunds contributed to slower sales.\\nEstimates vary on how much student loan borrowers will pay each month. The Bank of America Institute estimates that the median impacted household will pay around $180 a month. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz estimated that the typical monthly bill will be about $350. KeyBanc estimates an average monthly payment between $400 and $460.\\nKantrowitz said there is little data on how Americans used the money that they did not spend on student debt. Did they buy more luxury items, book a vacation or save?\\nHe said he\\'s skeptical that the resumption of payments will have a major effect on retailers, since the sum accounts for a tiny percentage of the country\\'s gross domestic product.\\n\"The impact on retailers is yes, it\\'s going to be a negative, but it\\'s not going to be a huge decrease,\" he said. \"It is a mild decrease.\"\\nBrett House, an economics professor at Columbia University\\'s business school, echoed similar sentiments. He said the student loan changes are modest compared with the pinch that people feel from inflation or the dwindling of pandemic-strengthened savings accounts.\\nHe added that many Americans have gotten raises since the payments paused three years ago.\\nThe end of student loan relief may hit some businesses harder than others.\\nSome of the most exposed companies are ones that sell a lot of discretionary merchandise, including Bath & Body Works, T.J. Maxx parent TJX Cos., Dick\\'s Sporting Goods and Best Buy, according to Wells Fargo analysts. Experience-driven companies are also at risk, including FanDuel\\'s parent company Flutter Entertainment, DraftKings and Lifetime Fitness, the firm said.\\nBarclays said American Eagle Outfitters,\\xa0Urban Outfitters\\xa0and\\xa0Figs are the most vulnerable because of their popularity among recent college graduates and newly employed.\\nSeveral equity research firms, including KeyBanc, named Target\\xa0as a retailer that will get squeezed, since its sales have already weakened and it draws younger and college-educated customers.\\nRetailers may not have accounted for consumers resuming student loan payments in their forecasts for the year, and most major players in the sector have not commented on the possible implications. The decision to stop extensions of the student loan pause, which was part of an agreement reached by Republicans and Democrats to raise the nation\\'s debt ceiling, came after the end of the retail earnings cycle.\\nThough some retailers may take a hit when payments resume, analysts and executives largely believe people will keep spending on dining out and airline tickets.\\nRick Cardenas, CEO of Olive Garden\\'s parent company Darden Restaurants, said last Thursday that the return of student loan payments will be a factor for the company, but not a significant one. Darden owns a mix of restaurant chains, including LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille.\\n\"Any time you take money out of consumers\\' pockets, it\\'s a headwind, but it shouldn\\'t be material, because student loan payments are a very small component,\" Cardenas told analysts on the company\\'s earnings conference call.\\nHe added that Darden\\'s customers will be better able to juggle the payments, since a high percentage earn more than $100,000 annually.\\nWall Street analysts don\\'t anticipate a big drop in sales for eateries when loan relief ends, either.\\nCiti Research analyst Jon Tower wrote in a March note to clients that it\\'s a \"contained risk\" for restaurants.\\nBTIG analyst Pete Saleh told CNBC that \"it will be just another drag on consumer spending, in addition to inflation.\"\\n\"But we know that historically, all of this other stuff is traditionally noise — what drives most restaurants\\' same-store sales and traffic is job growth and income growth, and we\\'re getting both of those right now,\" he said.\\nAirlines also may be more immune to the hit to borrowers\\' budgets.\\nStrong travel demand and airfares at about pre-pandemic levels helped lift some airlines\\' revenue to a record in the first quarter of the year, and airport security screenings on some days this month have surpassed pre-pandemic levels as consumers spend on experiences.\\n\"Given how much incomes have increased in the past three years, I can\\'t see how this is going to be a major challenge,\" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle told CNBC.\\nWhere airlines are more vulnerable to a pullback in spending is during off-peak periods.\\n\"You\\'re going to travel for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I think that\\'s engrained in the U.S. consumers\\' head,\" said Conor Cunningham, airline analyst at Melius Research. \"I\\'m not worried about summer travel. Summer travel is going to be amazing. It\\'s the off-peak stuff that\\'s got me worried.\"\\nThat usually occurs after the peak summer period and in between holidays when business travel — and during the pandemic, remote work and off-season trips — had been able to fill in the gaps. Some airlines could alter their schedules to adjust for weaker demand.\\nEven if many industries do not take a hit from the demise of student debt cancelation and the resumption of payments, millions of Americans will feel the change acutely.\\nTiffany Serra said the reality of her looming payments is \"starting to creep in and stress me out.\"\\nThe 23-year-old graduated in 2022 from Cornell College in Iowa with a bachelor\\'s degree in finance and environmental studies — along with $120,000 in debt. She is working a seasonal position on Shelter Island in New York and makes $22 an hour, along with having her housing costs covered. Serra said she has had trouble finding a full-time job.\\nStarting this fall, Serra will pay that debt down for the first time. She\\'s tried to prepare by socking away money to cover that big bill, which she expects will be at least $600 per month. Serra also embraced new habits to cut spending, including growing herbs at home and making her own oat milk.\\nStudent loan forgiveness would have made a small dent in her total debt, but Serra said she still wishes the plan had stuck. Serra recently got into law school, but decided to turn it down to avoid racking up more student loans.\\nShe said she\\'ll have to make tough decisions in the months ahead, such as whether she can afford to renew the lease on her car. She won\\'t have the breathing room that allowed her to buy steel-toed boots for work or book a trip to the San Francisco Bay Area to visit a friend.\\n\"It\\'s definitely going to be a large financial burden when I do have to start making those payments,\" Serra said.\\n— CNBC\\'s Amelia Lucas, Gabrielle Fonrouge, Leslie Josephs and Annie Nova contributed to this story.\\nDisclosure: CNBC\\'s parent company Comcast and NBC Sports are investors in FanDuel.\\n',\n",

No, your left. No, YOUR left. OK, now a little right. Never mind. Let\\'s try it again.\"\\nThat familiar headache, among others, is why Ford Motor is souping up technologies on its most expensive pickups to make the vehicles more manageable for newer owners and ease major pain points for veteran truck drivers.\\nThe Detroit automaker is adding features to its 2023 Ford Super Duty lineup to boost transaction prices of the trucks and ease difficulties with some of the vehicles\\' most important functions: towing and carrying/hauling.\\n\"This is really about making the truck safer for our customers, for equipment, for whatever you\\'re towing. It\\'s about productivity. It\\'s about ease. It\\'s about saving marriages,\" said Tim Baughman, general manager of Ford\\'s commercial business. \"With our new trailer-tow features, I\\'m sure we\\'ll be saving a couple marriages based on what it can now do.\"\\nMany pickup owners, especially newer ones, face headaches such as determining how much weight they can safely put in their vehicles or hitching trailers to their trucks, according to Ford.\\nThe latter challenge, specifically, can cause relationship troubles, as it can take two people and several tries to get positioning of the trucks and trailers correct for towing — like in our all-too-common but fictionalized scenario above.\\n\"Our team is obsessed with our customers,\" Baughman said. \"This is about customer understanding and customer obsession. And everything in this truck is purpose-built.\"\\nFord says 96% of its customers tow with its F-250 to F-450 Super Duty pickups, which are larger siblings to its well-known F-150 trucks. A majority also use the vehicles to haul heavy loads in the beds of the vehicles, which start from roughly $44,000 and can run more than $103,000, depending on the model.\\nTo assist with hitching and hauling, Ford is using technologies such as new camera features, automated assistance and smart weight taillights.\\nFord\\'s new \"Pro Trailer Hitch Assist\" takes the hassle out of the process. The truck automatically backs up and aligns the hitch ball to the trailer receiver. The feature is standard or available on several models, starting at $1,035.\\n\"It\\'s to help take the pain away,\" said Aaron Bresky, Ford Super Duty chief technology officer. \"People have to tow for recreation and work, and the more we can take the pain out, it becomes more natural.\"\\nThe 2023 F-Series Super Duty trucks can tow between 14,000 and 40,000 pounds, depending on the truck.\\nBeyond towing or trailering,\\xa0Ford\\'s Super Duty pickups can\\xa0themselves\\xa0haul a lot, up to 8,000 pounds, depending on the model.\\xa0That includes all the people, cargo and any objects that may be in the bed of the pickup.\\nBut having to guess or calculate how much you\\'re hauling can be tricky, especially when you have passengers in the vehicle or you don\\'t know how much your cargo weighs.\\nFord\\'s answer to this problem is something it calls \"Onboard Scales with Smart Hitch,\" which debuted on the 2021 F-150. The system uses scales in the vehicle to determine the total payload/weight of the vehicle.\\nDrivers can use the vehicle\\'s infotainment screen or app to determine the payload, but Ford\\'s also offering a more unique way of doing so. The vehicle\\'s taillamps light up in different levels to let an owner know how close they are to reaching the vehicle\\'s total payload limit.\\nIf the vehicle is over its certified payload, the top bar will blink, alerting the owner that they may need to rethink what they\\'re hauling or ditch a passenger or two.\\nThe taillights also can be used to balance a trailer with the vehicle, also known as a trailer tongue weight.\\nThe Onboard Scales with Smart Hitch is available for $650 on Lariat models and standard on higher-end trucks.\\nThe simplest new feature is a rearview camera mounted to the top of the vehicle\\'s tailgate. While it faces toward the sky when the gate is up, it provides a clear view of what\\'s behind the vehicle when the tailgate is lowered, offering an extra set of eyes when an owner is hauling something longer in the bed of the vehicle.\\nWhile all new vehicles are required to have rearview cameras, Ford is the first to implement such a camera that is useful for when the tailgate is down. Standard rearview cameras on American pickups face toward the ground when the tailgate is lowered.\\nThe option also comes with built-in sensors that work with the camera to notify drivers when their lowered tailgate is approaching an object.\\nThe new backup camera and sensors are standard on higher-end trims but not available on entry-level and lower-priced trucks.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Anyone who read a Fed chair coining the term \"soft-ish\" for an economic landing, as Jerome Powell did on Wednesday, as a bullish signal, has a transitory understanding of how much significance to give to any single day\\'s trading action. Stocks tanked on Thursday after the relief rally, giving up all of the post-FOMC meeting gains, and more, on pace for the worst day of 2022 for stocks.\\nNow back to the rougher economic reality, on Main Street, small business owners likely weren\\'t fooled by the market head fake at all. They have a sobering view of the rest of 2022. More than 80% of small business owners tell CNBC that a recession will hit the U.S. economy this year. The primary business issue they are facing is inflation, which is driving up prices they pay for raw goods and other inputs, while they are growing increasingly fearful about passing along more price increases to the consumer.\\nThe Fed\\'s battle with inflation is not one that Main Street has much confidence in right now. Just 27% of small business owners are confident in the Federal Reserve\\'s ability to control inflation, according to the just-released CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q2 2022, while 70% say the current Fed rate hike plans will have a negative impact on their business over the next six months.\\nFor Roger Ferguson, a former Fed vice chair and former head of investing giant TIAA, the Fed is doing what it can, but it can only do so much, and the downturn in market and economic sentiment won\\'t reverse quickly. He recently told CNBC the risk of recession is very high.\\nThe reasons for inflation, including the supply chain disruptions, geopolitical shocks from the Russian war in Ukraine, and the strong demand from consumers in the U.S. fueled by pandemic fiscal and monetary policy, can be mitigated by a Fed that is raising rates, but not entirely controlled.\\nEven the Fed\\'s forecast suggests inflation above 2% for at least a couple of more years, Ferguson, who is now vice chair at The Business Council and a distinguished fellow for International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, told the CNBC Small Business Playbook virtual event on Thursday. \"So there should be the expectation inflation will be bit of a challenge,\" he said.\\nHe cited some financial markets indicators which expect inflation to remain \"stubbornly high\" for several years to come, and while he isn\\'t in that camp, he added, \"it would be nice to say inflation will be behind us relatively quickly, but it will be an issue, though of lessening importance, for more than a year, perhaps two years.\"\\nHe sees signs that inflation might be peaking, but has no expectation it becomes dramatically lower.\\n\"We need to get used to inflation at some elevated levels, not getting worse but not getting better,\" Ferguson said.\\nFor small businesses, this means there will continue to be specific materials and commodities where supply remains limited, and inflation high, and while it will look like inflation may be getting marginally better, that will be incremental in the macro sense, and not the case with every single input cost. Labor costs will remain high though wage inflation should begin to slow too.\\n\"Powell, in his post-meeting conference, observed that the Fed has tools, as he described, \\'famously blunt\\' tools,\" Ferguson said.\\nAnd while Powell was clear that some factors might be outside their control (such as the supply chain functioning, Covid and war), \"he was clear that he sees a credible path toward bringing inflation back down to the target of around 2%, and doing so in a way that is soft or a \\'softish\\' landing,\" Ferguson said.\\nInflation will not be back at 2% soon, and the Fed has no illusions about that either, but it will slow and become less of a factor in business decisions, just not across the board, or soon.\\nFor small businesses, those who want to start a business today or are already running one, Ferguson said they should be expecting \"a pretty volatile time.\"\\nSmall businesses are a huge driver of the economy and job growth, he added, and from the supply issues to labor, the long-term outlook is positive if the Fed is successful in combatting inflation. But before we know the answer to that, the next 12 to 18 to 24 months, will \"perhaps be a little rocky,\" he said.\\n',\n",

Both camps are bearish, but small business owners are leading the way in negative sentiment — by a notable margin.\\nWall Street has been consumed with the Federal Reserve\\'s efforts to combat the inflation it pegged wrong for too long, and the risk that interest rate hikes will lead to a recession. A survey earlier this week from CNBC found that more than half of economists and investment professionals expect the Fed to fail in its mission to engineer a \"soft landing\" for the economy. The stock market breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday, with stocks surging after Fed chair Jerome Powell said that a more aggressive rate hike of 75 basis points is not being considered, and that the central bank remains convinced it can bring inflation down without crashing the economy.\\nThe market was giving back those brief gains on Thursday, and on Main Street, the central bank messaging was never likely to cause any short-term relief. Eight in ten small business owners expect a recession to occur this year, according to the latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q2 2022. Inflation remains the top concern for small business owners polled by CNBC and their business outlook is negative. The survey finds few small business owners seeing any bright spots in the current economy: just 6% rate the current state as excellent and 18% as good, while 31% rate it as fair and 44% rate it as poor.\\nWhile the survey\\'s small business confidence index ticked up for the first time in the Biden administration due to responses on core index questions related to immigration policy and a 3 percentage point increase (to 36%) among small business owners who described their current business conditions as good, it remains near its all-time lows and well below its pre-pandemic baseline.\\n\"There just isn\\'t a lot of optimism on Main Street these days,\" said Laura Wronski, senior manager of research science at Momentive, which conducts the survey for CNBC.\\nSmall business survey results can be influenced by politics, with the community skewing conservative, but economic worries are high among all small business owners. Those who identify as Republicans or lean to the GOP are leading the bearish outlook, with 91% expecting a recession, but among those who are Democrats or lean to the Democratic party, it is still 66% that expect a recession this year.\\nThe survey was conducted by Momentive between April 18-25 among a national sample of 2,027 self-identified small business owners.\\nIn a parallel survey of the general public conducted for CNBC, a nearly-identical 77% expect a recession to occur this year, again with Republicans more apt than Democrats to forecast economic trouble (87% vs. 71%).\\nThirty-eight percent of small business owners say inflation is their biggest concern, twice as many as the second place \"supply chain disruptions\" (19%) and well above Covid-19 (13%) and labor shortages (13%).\\nA majority of small business owners (75%) surveyed say they\\'re currently experiencing a rise in the cost of their supplies. But as much as they need to offset those rising costs by raising prices, the CNBC survey finds more are hesitant to pass on price hikes to consumers who are already hard-hit by inflation.\\nThe percentage of those raising prices is down from 47% to 40% quarter over quarter. Just 17% say now is a good time for businesses to raise prices in general, about half the number (35%) who say now is a bad time to raise prices. Almost half (47%) have mixed opinions on whether now is a good or bad time to raise prices.\\xa0\\nWhile this finding contrasts with other recent small business surveys showing that price increases are still a requirement for the majority of small businesses given the input cost inflation, the CNBC data matches a bleaker business outlook found in other recent Main Street data.\\nThe National Federal\\xa0of Independent Business monthly surveying shows the outlook for business conditions at the lowest level in its history, and that bearish view has increased sharply. The percentage of small business owners who expect conditions to be worse in the next six months hit a net negative 49% in March, the most recent month for which data is available, increasing from a net negative of 35% in the previous month. In August, that reading was at a net negative 28%.\\n\"The inflation pressures have continued, and now seem more built-in and foundational,\" said Holly Wade, director of the NFIB Research Center. \"It really is a concern about the ability to operate a business going forward, and it is incredibly stressful to find ways to balance absorbing the price increases from inputs and the level to which those price increases are passed along. ... Something has to break and it will likely be a recession,\" she said.\\n\"They can only do so much,\" said Eric Groves, co-founder and CEO at online small business platform Alignable. \"They are already inhibited from getting all the inventory they want, and the only way they get out of this is to bring customers back and drive more revenue, and they are struggling to figure it out.\"\\nHis firm\\'s research on small business anticipation of sales back to pre-pandemic levels continues to shift out in time. Since the end of 2021, every month of its data has shown a shift in outlook in when Main Street expects to be back to full recovery. At the beginning of this year, the expectation was Q1 of 2023, now it is Q4 2023.\\n\"The customers are not coming back as fast as they thought and inflation is squeezing margins. And with all of that going on, it is not surprising that the sentiment is that a recession is coming,\" Groves said. \"The ability to shift pricing to customers is not as strong as it is for a big box business.\"\\nThe challenge for many on Main Street has been the ability to access inventory they need to sell at a competitive rate, which remains much lower than for a big retailer. \"They are not getting their fair share of the widget,\" he said.\\nThe percentage of small businesses indicating they are back to at least 90% of pre-pandemic revenue, which had been a sign of health, is dropping again, according to Alignable, from 40% to 27% in its most recent data, as they attempt to compete against much better economics of scale.\\nEven the best market pundits have a weak track record at calling a recession, at least the exact timing, and there is no reason to expect that small business owners are any better at pinpointing this economic turning point. But such a negative view on the economy coming from a large component of it is significant.\\nThis hasn\\'t shown up in the Q1 business investment figures, which were solid, but a recent slowing in core durable goods shipments in the past two months suggests a slowing in the pace of business investment in Q2, according to Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. \"However, it is too early to say we are seeing a turning point and long lasting slowing in capex,\" she said.\\nConsumer sentiment is down sharply, according to the University of Michigan, but consumers continue to spend at a healthy clip and the Conference Board sentiment measure is higher, reflecting its consumer survey focus on the labor market, which remains hot.\\nRight now, with inventory levels so low, in large part due to the supply chain disruptions, companies need to continue to invest to rebuild inventory levels, as well as invest in technology for productivity gains, especially with the cost of labor so high. Business owners may be hiring less and doing more work themselves, but to recruit and retain any staff right now is likely critical to increasing sales as well.\\nThese requirements in the supply chain and labor market are adding to the stress level on Main Street, and ultimately, \"it can exert a real economic impact,\" Bostjancic said. \"Business owners\\' confidence levels can directly impact their investment decisions and hiring as well.\"\\n\"They are not seeing how the current environment is sustainable,\" Wade said. \"Consumer spending is strong and GDP is strong, but the stress they are feeling in trying to absorb these costs and fill positions and continue to increase compensation for retention and recruitment is all incredibly stressful,\" she said.\\nRobert Fry, an economist who is among the respondents to CNBC\\'s Fed Survey, remains of the view that a recession does not hit until late 2023, and he cited the words of Rudi Dornbusch, a famous MIT economics professor\\xa0who taught central bankers: \"A crisis takes a much longer time coming than you think, and then happens much faster than you thought.\"\\nHe views the current environment as still more rooted in negative sentiment than actual negative data. \"Three variables drive sentiment. The unemployment rate, the stock market, and the price of gasoline. And it\\'s not a weighted average. People just grab one at a time, and right now it\\'s gasoline prices.\"\\xa0\\n\"Ultimately, I think small businesses will be right, they\\'re just early,\" Fry said. \"They don\\'t appreciate the lags of monetary policy. ... people cry wolf for a long time, but the wolf eventually comes.\"\\xa0\\nGroves said how small business owners define recession may be less academic and more a reflection of just how tough their current operating conditions are, and what it will take to recover to pre-pandemic levels, and their ability to sustain the business through the next few years.\\nInflation putting pressure on margins, pushing back revenue goals and shifting out the timeline to full recovery, puts everything at risk for small business owners. \"It\\'s going to be more of a slog,\" Groves said, and to a business owner, that may feel like recession, regardless of the formal economic research. \"I don\\'t know what going into recession means versus the operating margins of my business being challenged, and how much I have to spend on things. ... and I have an econ degree,\" he said. \"You put your head down and do whatever you need to do to survive, and you do more with less, and you see them working more hours. Owners have to figure out a way through it.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Companies are under intense pressure to speak out on a variety of political issues at local, state and national levels. Whether it is police action in a city, Disney in Florida, or the likely wave of calls for more business response to the bombshell leak related to overturning the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case, the current era is one in which business leaders are expected to take a stand, or face potentially worse repercussions for remaining silent.\\nThere may be no more influential voice in the Democratic Party — no less from a state that has featured prominently in big political-corporate fault lines — than Stacey Abrams, current candidate in the Georgia governor race. But Abrams says that assuming companies should speak out on every political issue is a mistake.\\n\"Performative value means nothing to me,\" Abrams said on Thursday at CNBC\\'s Small Business Playbook virtual event. \"It shouldn\\'t be performing values because you think that\\'s what people want to see from you.\"\\nAbrams is a small business owner, and at the CNBC event, she made clear that she is a \"capitalist.\"\\n\"We should want to make money,\" she said.\\nBut it is important to remember, Abrams added, especially for small businesses, \"that we enter the world as citizens, we don\\'t divorce ourselves from who we are when we open the doors.\"\\nThis means also accepting that customers come with their full selves when they come through the doors and any decision to speak out on politics is a decision to show your full self to those customers.\\n\"We should be really selective about the way we are willing to impose our belief systems,\" Abrams said. \"But some things are so fundamental about who we are, we have too,\" she added.\\nFor the 1.1 million small business owners in her home state of Georgia, she said making choices about where to take a stand on political issues implies being willing to lose business, even if another form of value is gained.\\nDuring every major movement in this country\\'s history, from civil rights to women\\'s rights to LGBTQ rights, businesses have had to stand up. But the answer should not always be a reflective \"yes,\" and it shouldn\\'t be based on an accounting of only dollars and cents.\\n\"The decision should be because you can\\'t meet your own moral compass, can\\'t be respectful of your own moral core,\" Abrams said.\\nHer co-founder, Lara Hodgson — who is more conservative politically and with whom Abrams co-authored the recent book \"Level Up\" — said some businesses are created with purpose as part of their DNA. Their latest venture together, Now, which provides invoice payment solutions to small business owners for a fee, serves a diverse set of clients, employees and investors. And Hodgson and Abrams have to make sure they are true to what the business is built on, and that is to help small business owners facing cash flow difficulties.\\nWhen a business pivots — as theirs did after a failed effort to create the next \"global beverage giant\" under the brand Nourish, as Hodgson described their effort to create a better lineup of children\\'s spill-proof drinks — it is important to remember that a pivot represents not a total change of direction, but a fundamental position from which a new opportunity is being sought. For Abrams and Hodgson, that pivot DNA may include certain beliefs, but from a market opportunity perspective, it led to the problem of small business financing. \"Don\\'t use the business to go out and talk about other things,\" Hodgson said. \"We are very laser focused on leveling the playing field for small business.\"\\nThe two often have disagreements, and they have different strengths and weaknesses. Abrams, who ran one of the most successful voter registration drives in modern history and was credited with delivering key Georgia races to the Democratic Party, says she is great with numbers that many entrepreneurs (and legislators) don\\'t understand.\\n\"We\\'re very different, we\\'re not best friends,\" Abrams said. \"This gives us space to be incredibly honest, and not be in each others\\' lives every minute of the day. If you\\'re waking up and working and going to bed talking to the same person, it will cloud your mind and create an echo chamber.\"\\xa0\\nHodgson said when they do disagree, they approach the topic with curiosity first and criticality second.\\n\"When one of us shares a point of view, rather than jumping to judgment, we ask ourselves what can we be curious about, what can we learn from,\" she said.\\nAnd amid differences of opinion, sharing a firm of idea of impact and outcome will outweigh any particular points of friction. \"99.9% of the goal, we agree on the outcome, and how we would go about getting there is very different, but as long as the focus is the outcome and the impact, the different approaches are incredibly positive,\" Hodgson said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Small business owners have had a few rough years.\\nFirst, the Covid-19 pandemic caused many to lose revenue. Now, they\\'re dealing with higher costs as inflation rises.\\nThe consumer price index, which measures the prices of goods and services, increased 8.5% in March from a year ago, while the producer price index, which measures prices paid by wholesalers, jumped 11.2% year over year in March.\\nFor Kate Russell, 40, co-owner of Kentucky-based Hopskinsville Brewing Company, that means everything from equipment and aluminum to grain and fuel has gotten more expensive.\\nOn average, her total costs have gone up about 15% to 20%.\\n\"We sat on that as long as we could before we finally had to just break down and raise prices,\" she said. \"We felt really bad about that. We still feel very bad about that.\"\\nInflation, as well as supply-chain issues and workforce challenges, are weighing heavily on businesses. Some 91% said these broader economic trends are having a negative impact on their business, according to a survey of 1,107 small business owners from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices. Fully 73% said increasing energy costs are having negative impacts on their bottom lines.\\nHowever, like Russell, small business owners are hesitant to raise prices, according to the latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q2 2022.\\nSome 75% said they are currently experiencing a rise in the cost of their supplies, yet only 40% are increasing prices. That\\'s down from the 47% of owners who adjusted prices in the first quarter.\\nStill, passing the cost on to consumers is the main tool small business owners are turning to, a separate survey by the National Federation of Independent Business found. They are also absorbing some of the higher costs. Some 31% are taking on debt.\\n\"Inflation is a new challenge for most small business owners that are currently operating,\" said Holly Wade, executive director of the NFIB Research Center.\\n\"They\\'re finding it incredibly difficult to navigate having to absorb these increased prices, and also anticipating how long these price increases might last,\" Wade added.\\nMore from Invest in You:How small businesses can avoid financial misstepsWhat Americans plan to spend more money on prices go higherEmployers boost mental wellness benefits amid the Great Resignation\\nSmall-business owners are also getting creative, looking for alternative solutions, such as reducing the quantity of goods and services offered to help stabilize costs, the survey found.\\nIt\\'s something Jennifer Glanville, director of partnerships and collaborations at Boston Beer Company, sees in her role as head of the company\\'s Brewing the American Dream program.\\nThe initiative partners with nonprofit lenders to help with access to capital and also offers one-on-one coaching for small business owners.

She and her partner have also taken pay cuts.\\nFortunately, costumers aren\\'t really complaining about the increase in prices, she said, since it\\'s happening across the board in the economy.

       "    'content': \"Fewer small business owners now than a year ago approve of the job Joe Biden is doing as president. In fact, small business owners are twice as likely to disapprove than to approve of Biden, according to the latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey, which was conducted April 18-25 among 2,027 small business owners in the U.S.\\xa0\\nBiden's approval among this group hasn't budged for the past three quarters, but few small business owners have been particularly focused on politics during that time. Instead, for the third straight quarter, inflation dominates concerns on Main Street. In this latest survey, about four in 10 small business owners (38%) report inflation to be the biggest risk to their business right now, at least twice the number who point to supply chain disruptions (19%), labor shortages (13%), or Covid-19 (13%).\\xa0\\nAbout three in four small business owners say they are currently experiencing a rising cost in supplies, a number that has held steady since the fourth quarter of 2021.\\xa0\\nAmong those experiencing increasing costs, 40% say they are having to increase their prices to keep up, and another 35% are planning to raise their prices if their costs continue to escalate.\\xa0\\nStill, that leaves 24% who are absorbing the rising costs without raising prices of their own. With inflation rising in every sector, small businesses may be the most reluctant to raise their own prices because they lack some of the price-setting power that helps large corporations keep their dominance.\\xa0\\nOne of the worries about inflation is how quickly it can spiral out of control: as prices increase at every stage of production, they push prices up further at each subsequent stage. In addition, as prices rise, companies are forced to boost wages, but those higher wages lead to consumers being able to spend more money, and the cycle continues.\\xa0\\nBut you won't see much acceptance of price gouging on Main Street. Small business owners seem especially reluctant to take advantage of the current inflationary environment by passing on higher costs to their customers. Overall, twice as many small business owners say now is a bad time to raise prices than say now is a good time to raise prices.\\xa0\\nObviously small business owners can't fight off inflation on their own; it's squarely in the realm of the Federal Reserve and the Biden administration to determine policy changes that can curtail the widespread price increases. So far, few on Main Street are impressed with the response.\\xa0\\nThis quarter, just 27% of small business owners say they are confident in the Federal Reserve's ability to control inflation, almost exactly matching last quarter's 28%. On Wednesday, Chairman Jerome Powell announced that the Fed would increase interest rates by half a percentage point –the first such step taken since the recent inflation run began last year.\\xa0\\nNot coincidentally, right as inflation began rising last fall, small business owners' approval of the way Joe Biden is doing his job as president sank – and it has stayed there ever since. For the first three quarters of his presidency, Biden averaged a 42% approval rating among small businesses: not great, but not awful when considering that a majority of small business owners align more with the Republican Party than the Democrats.\\nFor the past three quarters, Biden's approval rating has dropped to the low 30's, and fewer small business owners approve of Biden now than ever before. Other polling suggests Biden needs to get a handle on inflation in order to help prop up his lagging job approval.\\xa0\\nMuch like in our quarterly survey, Biden's approval in general public opinion polling started sinking last fall, just as inflation was beginning to rise. The FiveThirtyEight presidential approval tracker pinpoints August 29, 2021 as the inflection point when Biden's disapproval surpassed his approval in polling averages. Even at that time, the rate at which prices were rising was breaking records.\\xa0\\nIn a new poll from the Washington Post and ABC News, Biden's job approval ticked up slightly from February to April and now stands at 42% overall. That number is still well below the 52% high mark Biden had in the first Washington Post/ABC News poll of his presidency in April of last year.\\xa0\\nThis latest poll is particularly prescriptive for Biden because it asked about different aspects of presidential approval. Even though his overall approval rating is underwater, a majority of adults in the U.S. (51%) approve of Biden's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Fewer approve of his handling of the Russia/Ukraine situation, his ability to create jobs, or his handling of the economy in general. And, down at the very bottom of the list, just 28% approve of his handling of inflation.\\xa0\\nPresidents get credit for a strong economy in good times and blame for a struggling economy during bad times, as Biden is experiencing now. With inflation top-of-mind across the country, including on Main Street, Biden's job approval won't recover unless he takes it on.\\n\",\n",

Zumper data shows that growth is particularly strong in Sun Belt cities such as Miami, where rents have risen to $2,700 a month in May 2022, a 64% increase from a year prior.\\nDuring the pandemic, workers left the largest U.S. cities. Two years in, renters have returned but many commuters haven\\'t as companies negotiate the particulars of a return to the office. Public officials are concerned about lagging transit ridership in cities such as New York.Ed Glaeser, an economist at Harvard University, says cities are becoming more important — not less — in the age of remote work. \"When you Zoom to work, you miss the opportunity to watch the people who are older, to watch what they\\'ve done and to learn from them,\" he told CNBC in an interview.\\nBut for renters, a return to increasingly expensive cities might seem like a raw deal, especially if they can do their jobs from home.\\nResearchers say remote work limits firms\\' ability to train new workers. Data produced by Microsoft\\'s workforce suggests that it is more difficult to share in-depth information remotely, which can produce silos within companies\\' rank and file. \"A lot of these tech companies, they\\'re saying you can work remotely,\" said Andra Ghent, a professor of finance at the University of Utah.\\xa0\"But, you know, in many cases, they\\'re also saying, like, we\\'re not going to pay you quite the same amount.\"\\nWatch the video above to find out whether major cities are still worth it.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': \"Some of the highest profile cyberattacks on the U.S. in recent years are alleged to have originated in Russia, including the 2021 attack on the Colonial Pipeline — the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S. — the SolarWinds attack in 2020, and the 2016 hacking into the Democratic National Committee.\\xa0\\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in January of this year, the U.S. government has warned of an elevated risk of a cyber attack, which Russia could use to try to draw the U.S. into a direct conflict. Despite the increased threat, small business owners are no more concerned about a potential cyber attack — and no more prepared to deal with one should it occur — than they were a year ago.\\nThe CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey checks in with more than 2,000 small business owners every quarter to understand their outlook on the overall business environment along with their own business's health. In the latest survey, just 5% of small business owners reported cybersecurity to be the biggest risk to their business right now.\\xa0\\nQuarter over quarter, the number saying cybersecurity is their top risk has held steady and is the lowest priority out of the five surveyed. In the same time period, the number of small business owners who say inflation is the biggest risk to their business has increased from 31% to 38%, holding the top spot in terms of risk. The numbers reporting supply chain disruptions and Covid-19 as the biggest risk have both declined.\\xa0\\nThis latest round of the Small Business Survey is the first to field after the Russian invasion into Ukraine, though the international events have had no perceptible impact on small business sentiment in the U.S.\\xa0\\nWhile it isn't their top worry, almost four in 10 small business owners say they are very or somewhat concerned their business will be the victim of a cyber attack within the next 12 months. This trend, too, has held steady for four straight quarters, with no change at all since the Russian incursion into Ukraine.\\xa0\\nThe smallest of small businesses are the least concerned about cyber attacks: just 33% of owners with 0-4 employees are concerned about experiencing a cyber attack within a year, compared with 61% of small business owners who have 50 or more employees.\\xa0\\nFew small business owners rate cyber threats at their top business risk, and fewer than half consider it to be a concern, but nevertheless a majority express confidence in their ability to respond to a cyber attack. Just as in previous quarters, about six in 10 small business owners are very or somewhat confident that they could quickly resolve a cyber attack on their business if needed.\\xa0\\nThis general lack of concern among small business owners diverges from the sentiment among the general public. In SurveyMonkey's own polling, three quarters of Americans say they expect businesses in the U.S. to experience a major cyber attack within the next 12 months.\\xa0\\nConsumers' expectations for cyber-preparedness vary from industry to industry. A majority of people in the general public say they have confidence that their banks (71%), their health-care providers (64%), and their email providers (55%) are equipped to protect them from cybersecurity threats; on the other hand, just 32% expect the social media platforms they use to be prepared.\\xa0\\nWe see similar results in the small business realm. Small business owners in the finance and insurance industries are some of the most confident that they would be able to quickly respond to a cyber attack; more than seven in 10 say they would be able to combat an attack. Among those in the arts, entertainment, and recreation industry that number falls to 50%.\\xa0\\nThat's important, because any cyber attack – even one that is quickly resolved – can have a long-lasting negative impact on a business. Consumers would rather not be the victim of a cybersecurity attack themselves, and they are wary to trust businesses that have been compromised in the past. In SurveyMonkey's polling, 55% of people in the U.S. say they would be less likely to continue to do business with brands who are victims of a cyber attack.\\nFor small businesses to truly be prepared, they need to take more concrete steps. Fewer than half each say they have installed antivirus or malware software, strengthened their passwords, or backed up files on an external hard drive to protect their business against potential cyberattacks. Only a third each have enabled automatic software updates or enabled multi-factor authentication. Just one quarter have installed a virtual private network (VPN).\\xa0\\nThese are basic actions that most companies in corporate America would consider to be table stakes, but they are admittedly much more costly to implement in a small business environment. Small businesses that fail to take the cyber threat seriously risk losing customers, or much more, if a real threat emerges.\\xa0\\n\",\n",

Funding of £407,000 (around $495,300) for the project has been provided by the U.K. government.\\nIt will be run by the Scottish Association for Marine Science in partnership with its trading subsidiary SAMS Enterprise and educational institution UHI Argyll.\\nMorgan Stanley upgrades this  mining stock that can surge more than 20%\\nGoldman says buy these 7 underperforming energy stocks\\nAccording to a statement from SAMS, one of the academy\\'s goals centers around stimulating \"the growth of UK seaweed aquaculture.\" On top of this, the project will look to explore \"high-value markets\" and use research to boost the worldwide competitiveness of U.K. products.\\nRhianna Rees is a seaweed researcher and Seaweed Academy coordinator at SAMS Enterprise. In a recent interview with CNBC, she provided an insight into the type of jobs that went on at a seaweed farm.\\n\"It\\'s a lot less industrial than it might come across,\" she said. \"When you think of farming you think of big machinery, you think of mechanical harvesting, and that\\'s not at all what seaweed farming is about.\"\\n\"When you look at it from the outside, all you can see are buoys in the water and then under the water are these long lines of rope with … huge swathes of seaweed,\" she went on to explain.\\n\"When you want to harvest it, you go in and you get the rope and you pull it into the boat — and that\\'s basically it,\" she said.\\nThe apparent simplicity of the process is one thing, but setting up a farm in the first place can be a different story altogether.\\n\"Getting licenses from ... the different organizations within England and Scotland — it can be incredibly expensive and time consuming,\" Rees said. \"So there are major challenges to entering the industry in the first place.\"\\nThere were also other factors to consider. \"You get storm events, you get maybe years where it doesn\\'t grow particularly well, fluctuations in nutrients,\" she said.\\nThere was innovation on the horizon, Rees went on to note, but it would \"take a few years to get to the area where we see the kind of optimization that we need for real scalability.\"\\nThe U.K.\\'s interest in cultivating and harvesting seaweed is not restricted to the work being planned in and around Oban.\\nIn the picturesque county of Cornwall on the southwest tip of England, the Cornish Seaweed Company has been harvesting since 2012, providing a glimpse of how the wider industry could develop in the years ahead.\\nTim van Berkel, who co-founded the company and is its managing director, told CNBC the firm wild-harvested seaweed from the shores for food purposes.\\nIn 2017, the business supplemented this shore-based harvesting when it started to farm seaweed from spores at the site of an existing mussel farm in waters off Porthallow, a Cornish fishing village.\\xa0\\n\"They grow on lines suspended in the water, like buoys really,\" van Berkel said, adding that it was \"similar to mussel farming.\" The business was farming two types of seaweed at the site, van Berkel said: sugar kelp and alaria.\\nWhy the \\'Mother of Dragons\\' at SpaceX left her job building rockets to work on nuclear fusion\\nEl Niño is here and could bring warmer temperatures, more extreme weather patterns\\nSchwarzenegger: ‘No one gives a s--- about’ climate change — call it this instead\\nDespite establishing the site at Porthallow, for now the company\\'s core focus relates to its shore-based harvesting. \"That\\'s really still the main business,\" van Berkel said. \"There\\'s five, six, other seaweeds that we harvest ... from the wild, from the shores, which is going on year round.\"\\nOther companies looking to make their mark include SeaGrown, which is based in the coastal town of Scarborough, Yorkshire, and is working on setting up a seaweed farm in the North Sea.\\nFurther north, Seaweed Farming Scotland\\'s operations are located in Oban and focused on the cultivation of species native to the waters there.\\nIn 2020, a report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N. described seaweed farming as being \"dominated by countries in East and Southeast Asia.\"\\nThe industry is big business, with the FAO separately noting that the seaweed sector generated $14.7 billion in \"first-sale value\" in 2019.\\nWith the U.K.\\'s commercial seaweed sector still in its early stages, it has a way to go before it competes on the global stage.\\nSeaweed farming in Asia can often be large-scale, with sites spread across quite considerable areas, as shown in the above photo of a farm in the province of Zhejiang, China.\\nThe U.S. is also home to a seaweed farming sector, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration stating there are now \"dozens of farms\" in waters off New England, Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.\\nAlongside the commercial products resulting from seaweed farming, there are other benefits too, an obvious one being that it does not require fresh water.\\nFor its part, the NOAA says that \"seaweeds are incredibly efficient at sucking up carbon dioxide and using it to grow.\" In addition, it notes that \"seaweeds also gobble up nitrogen and phosphorus.\"\\nWhile there are concerns related to permitting in some parts of the U.S., the industry there has expanded in recent years, with the NOAA calling it the \"fastest-growing aquaculture sector.\"\\nIt adds that 2019 saw Alaska-based farmers produce over 112,000 pounds of sugar, ribbon, and bull kelp. \"That\\'s a 200 percent increase over the state\\'s first commercial harvest in 2017,\" it says.\\nWorldwide, the industry seems to have been on a rapid course of expansion over the past two decades or so. The FAO\\'s report said global marine macroalgae — another name for seaweed — production had risen from 10.6 million metric tons in 2000 to 32.4 million metric tons in 2018.\\nIt\\'s not all been plain sailing, however. \"Global production of farmed aquatic algae, dominated by seaweeds, experienced relatively low growth in the most recent years, and even fell by 0.7 percent in 2018,\" the FAO\\'s report noted.\\nAnd while there would appear to be a multitude of products and benefits linked to seaweed farming, there are also issues those working in the industry will need to address and carefully manage going forward.\\xa0\\nThe World Wildlife Fund, for example, notes that, in some instances, species of seaweed have become \"invasive when grown outside their natural range.\"\\nThe WWF also cites the \"entanglement of protected species with seaweed farm rope structures\" as a \"potential concern\" but adds that such an occurrence is unlikely and \"no credible documented marine entanglements\" have taken in place in 40 years.\\nBack in Scotland, the Seaweed Academy\\'s Rees is optimistic for what the future holds. \"I think we\\'re really poised to see the growth,\" she said. \"I just hope that the hype isn\\'t hype for the wrong reasons.\"\\n\"And as long as we\\'re all … working together to get the message and to get the training and to get development right, along with support from governments and investors, then we\\'ll see something that\\'s really beneficial for the world, really sustainable.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'With hype over the \"buy now, pay later\" trend fading, some investors are betting they\\'ve found the next big thing.\\nBuy now, pay later companies like Klarna and Affirm, which let shoppers defer payments to a later date or break up purchases into interest-free installments, are under immense strain as consumers become more wary about spending due to the rising cost of living, and as higher interest rates push up borrowing costs. They\\'re also facing increased competition, with tech giant Apple entering the ring with its own BNPL offering.\\nBut venture capitalists are betting a new breed of startups from Europe will be the real winners in the space. Companies like Mondu, Hokodo and Billie have raked in heaps of cash from investors with a simple pitch: businesses — not consumers — are a more lucrative clientele for the buy now, pay later trend.\\n\"There\\'s a big opportunity out there with regards to \\'buy now, pay later\\' for the B2B [business-to-business] space,\" said Malte Huffman, co-CEO of Mondu, a Berlin-based startup.\\nHuffman, whose firm recently raised $43 million in funding from investors including Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel\\'s Valar Ventures, predicts the market for BNPL in B2B transactions in Europe and the U.S. will reach $200 billion over the next few years.\\nWhereas services like Klarna extend credit for consumer purchases — say, a new pair of jeans or a flashy speaker system — B2B BNPL firms aim to settle transactions between businesses. It\\'s different to some other existing forms of short-term finance like working capital loans, which cover firms\\' everyday operational costs, and invoice factoring, where a company sells all or part of a bill for faster access to cash they\\'re owed.\\nPatrick Norris, a general partner at private equity firm Notion Capital, said the market for B2B BNPL was \"much bigger\" than that of business-to-consumer, or B2C. Notion recently led a $40 million investment in Hokodo, a B2B BNPL firm based in the U.K.\\n\"The average basket size in B2B is much larger than the average consumer basket,\" Norris said, adding this makes it easier for firms to generate revenue and achieve scale.\\nShares of major consumer-focused BNPL players have fallen sharply in 2022 as concerns about a potential recession weigh on the sector.\\nSweden\\'s Klarna is in talks to raise funds at a sharp discount to its last valuation, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal\\xa0 — down to $15 billion from $46 billion in 2021. A Klarna spokesperson said the firm doesn\\'t comment on \"speculation.\"\\nStateside, publicly-listed fintech Affirm has seen its stock plunge more than 75% since the start of the year, while shares of Block, which purchased Australian BNPL firm Afterpay for $29 billion, have fallen 57%. PayPal, which offers its own installment loans feature, is down 60% year-to-date.\\nBNPL took off in the coronavirus pandemic, offering shoppers a convenient way to split payments into smaller chunks with just a few clicks at retailers\\' checkout pages. Now, businesses are getting in on the trend.\\n\"Businesses are still facing cash flow issues in light of worsening macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing supply chain crisis, so any way of receiving money faster on a flexible basis is going to appeal,\" said Philip Benton, fintech analyst at market research firm Omdia.\\nMondu and Hodoko haven\\'t disclosed their valuations publicly, but Italy\\'s Scalapay and Germany\\'s Billie were last valued at $1 billion and $640 million, respectively.\\nBNPL services are proving especially popular with small and medium-sized enterprises, which are also feeling the pinch from rising inflation. SMEs have long been \"underserved\" by big banks, according to Mondu chief Huffman.\\n\"Banks cannot really go down in ticket size to make it economical because the contribution margin they would get with such a loan doesn\\'t cover the associated costs,\" he said.\\xa0\\n\"At the same time, fintech companies have proven that a more data-driven approach and a more automated approach to credit can actually make it work and expand the addressable market.\"\\nBNPL products have been met with pushback from some regulators due to fears that they may be pushing people to get into debt that they can\\'t afford, as well as a lack of transparency around late payment fees and other charges.\\nThe U.K. has led the charge on the regulatory front, with government officials hoping to bring in stricter rules for the sector as early as 2023.\\xa0Still, Norris said business-focused BNPL companies face less regulatory risk than firms like Klarna.\\n\"Regulation in B2C is going to offer much needed protection to consumers and help them to shop smart and stay out of debt,\" he said. \"In B2B, the risk of businesses overspending on items they don\\'t need is negligible.\"\\nOne thing the B2B players will need to be wary of, however, is the level of risk they\\'re taking on. With a possible recession on the horizon, a big challenge for B2B BNPL startups will be sustaining high growth while also preparing for potential insolvencies, Norris said.\\n\"B2B will generally be high value, low volume so naturally the risk appetite will be higher and affordability checks more important,\" Omdia\\'s Benton said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'For decades Microsoft has been associated with a traditional definition of office work, long hours in front of a computer, but now the corporate enterprise giant finds Gen Z entrepreneurs disrupting ideas about workplace hustle and the traditional 9-5 day.\\xa0Many recent Gen Z college graduates are flipping the career paradigm and pursuing entrepreneurship rather than entering the corporate world.\\xa0\\n\"We\\'ve seen a lot of reimagination during the pandemic and a lot of digital transformation, which I think really has propelled what we see as a bit of a boom in entrepreneurship,\" says Travis Walter, vice president of retail at Microsoft Store. Almost two-thirds (62%) of Gen Z has indicated they have started, or intend to start, their own business, according to data from WP Engine and the Center for Generational Kinetics. Meanwhile, in 2021 alone, 5.4 million Americans submitted applications to start their own business, according to government data.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe traditional idea of \"hustle culture\" has evolved over the years, and while the grind Gen Z puts in looks slightly different than millennials, it doesn\\'t mean they\\'re doing any less work. Instead, these entrepreneurs wear multiple hats with flexible work schedules, working vacations and more consideration for personal time. Nearly half of Gen Z, about 48%, have numerous side hustles, compared to 34% of small business owners, according to Microsoft\\'s survey, conducted by Wakefield Research across 1,000 small business owners with less than 25 employees.\\xa0Many of these businesses overlap with the rise in social media marketing. Entrepreneurs who use TikTok for their business (48%) are almost twice as likely to have multiple side hustles as those who do not (27%), according to the Microsoft data.\\n\"I think it\\'s important to let people work the way they need to work because then they can actually do their best work, as we\\'re seeing with entrepreneurs and Gen Z,\" Walter said.\\nMicrosoft\\'s data shows 91% of Gen Z entrepreneurs work unconventional hours; 81% say they work on vacation, compared to 62% of business owners overall.\\xa0\\n\"What do I truly want to do?\" is a question being asked more frequently, according to Philip Gaskin, vice president of entrepreneurship at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. \"That\\'s some of that Gen Z energy,\" he said.\\nGen Z graduates are coming into the workforce during the pandemic period of \"rediscovery,\" Gaskin said, a reevaluation of personal and professional goals by many Americans across generations. Some people who may have been bored of their corporate jobs, or felt stale at a point in life, were given the time to pause and reevaluate. Many people who saw an opportunity went for it during the pandemic, often with new technology ideas. The boom in new business formation isn\\'t uniformly a rosy scenario. In some cases, it is a function of necessity, according to Kauffman\\'s analysis, with people who lost their jobs needing new forms of income.\\nThis shift is correlated with a rate of new entrepreneurs that has been growing for several years, with 2020 showing the highest spike of all, according to Kauffman Foundation data. And it has big implications for the labor market. \"Most jobs created over the last five years were provided by firms less than five years old,\" Gaskin said.\\nGen-Z is also leaning more towards the entrepreneurship path rather than getting involved in corporate America right out of college because many see it as a way to fast-track their retirement. About 61% of Gen Z small business owners believe they will be able to retire faster than if they had gotten a corporate job, compared to 40% of all small business owners who hold this view, according to the Microsoft survey.\\xa0Among the broader small business community, amassing retirement savings through investment vehicles has historically been a challenge and much of their income directly reinvested in the business, which has provided reason for concern about financial security among entrepreneurs.\\nRitwik Pavan, a Gen Z entrepreneur, has already started several businesses.\\n\"I\\'ve been on the entrepreneurial journey since high school, and I always wanted to build something because I always had the problem-solving type of mindset,\" Pavan said.\\nThe big idea he landed on after working in various tech niches, including app development, since college, is in urban mobility.\\nWith co-founders Matthew Schaefer and Christian Burke, he launched Vade in 2018, which helps reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions by providing real-time parking data for citizens.\\n\"I\\'m helping all these people solve problems and build their ideas, but I\\'d love to go find something I\\'m passionate about solving and for me, that problem was parking,\" Pavan said. \"The best part about being an entrepreneur is that we\\'re very mission-driven and believe that what we\\'re going to do is going to change lives for the better and help cities become better places to live,\" he said.\\nAccording to the Microsoft survey, around 88% of all small business owners who prioritize social good say it helped their business grow, including 82% of Gen Z respondents.\\xa0\\nPavan is an example of how work hustle has changed. His favorite part about being a small business owner is the flexibility that comes with the job, but that doesn\\'t mean working fewer hours than a corporate boss like Jamie Dimon or Elon Musk demands.\\n\"The truth is, as a founder, for the first three years me and my co-workers were working 18-hour days, even 20 hour days, even now sometimes,\" Pavan said.\\nBut being able to make decisions for your own company, he says, makes the long hours worthwhile, even if that also means being responsible for the bad ones.\\xa0According to the Microsoft data, many Gen Z entrepreneurs start this decision-making, like Pavan, before college, and many don\\'t see a degree as being critical to their success: 78% of Gen Z entrepreneurs say a college education is \"not very necessary\" for them to run a business.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'An insurance agency in Millinocket, Maine, is facing online backlash after a photo circulated on Facebook of a sign taped to the business\\'s door on Monday saying, \"Juneteenth ~it\\'s whatever... We\\'re closed. Enjoy your fried chicken & collard greens.\"\\nThe image of the sign at the Harry E. Reed Insurance Agency, an affiliate of national insurer Progressive, was originally shared by a Facebook user named Alura Stillwagon, with the caption, \"The racism in Millinocket is real.\" The original post has been shared more than 200 times, though a similar post by a different user has been shared more than 10,000 times. \\n\"I\\'m not angry. Anger gets you nowhere. I\\'m just deeply, deeply disappointed,\" another Facebook user, Ken Anderson, commented on the post. \"In this business, in the companies that let this business broker their products, and in the town of Millinocket, in the state of Maine, and the whole damn country. Deeply disappointed. Why? Because I know we can do better. But we\\'re not trying. And that\\'s the part that cuts deepest.\"\\nFor many businesses, Monday marked the observance of Juneteenth, a federal holiday that commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Army soldiers arrived in Texas and announced the end of slavery to more than 250,000 Black people who remained enslaved even after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\\nThe insurance agency did not respond to CNBC\\'s requests for comment, but Melanie Higgins told News Center Maine she was the employee who posted the sign and apologized.\\n\"I would never purposely set out to hurt anyone and I would never purposely set out to hurt my mom\\'s business at all. She had nothing to do with this,\" Higgins said. \"I truly apologize.\"\\nSince the image of the sign began circulating online, people have taken to online review site Yelp to condemn the insurance agency, prompting Yelp to disable users\\' ability to post on the company\\'s page.\\n\"This business recently received increased public attention resulting in an influx of people posting their views to this page, so we have temporarily disabled the ability to post here as we work to investigate the content,\" an alert on the Harry E. Reed Insurance Agency\\'s Yelp page reads. \"While racism has no place on Yelp and we unequivocally reject racism or discrimination in any form, all reviews on Yelp must reflect an actual first-hand consumer experience (even if that means disabling the ability for users to express points of view we might agree with).\"\\nThe agency received nearly 90 — largely one-star — Yelp reviews, with many posters condemning the insurance agency as \"racist.\"\\nJeff Sibel, a spokesperson for Progressive, said in a statement, \"We\\'re aware and appalled by the sign recently posted at the Harry E Reed Agency and are terminating our relationship with the agency.\"\\n\"At Progressive, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) are fundamental to our Core Values. We\\'re committed to creating an environment where our people feel welcomed, valued and respected and expect that anyone representing Progressive to take part in this commitment.\\xa0The sign is in direct violation of that commitment and doesn\\'t align with our company\\'s Core Values and Code of Conduct,\" Sibel said in a statement.\\nThe chair of the Millinocket Town Council, Steve Golieb, released a statement Tuesday denouncing the sign.\\n\"It is deeply saddening, disgraceful and unacceptable for any person, business or organization to attempt to make light of Juneteenth and what it represents for millions of slaves and their living descendants,\" Golieb wrote. \"There is no place in the Town of Millinocket for such a blatant disregard of human decency.\"\\nPresident Joe Biden and the state of Maine each signed bills into law in June 2021 recognizing Juneteenth as a federal and state holiday.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'When Cornelia Quinn, co-founder of Go-Be, which makes reusable antimicrobial airplane tray covers, needed help to pack and fulfill orders, she looked no further than her 19-year-old son, Jake, who has autism.\\nAs someone with autism, finding employment is challenging. More than half of young adults with autism are unemployed. Unemployment for neurodivergent adults is as high as 30% to 40%, three times the rate for people with a disability — up to 85% of people on the autism spectrum are unemployed, according to a recent Deloitte report. Neurodiversity is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of conditions including autism, ADHD, dyspraxia, and dyslexia. With one in 45 adults on the autism spectrum alone, that\\'s a lot of untapped labor market potential.\\nThis is a significant data point for employers amid the current labor crunch. About half of U.S. states now have unemployment rates below pre-pandemic levels — a 50-year low — while 13 states have unemployment rates below 3%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That means employers are struggling to fill open positions and are more willing to look more closely at previously overlooked segments of the population.\\xa0\\n\"Employers are trying multiple methods of hiring and looking at resources that may not have before, said John Dooney, HR advisor at the Society for Human Resource Management.\\n\"Everyone is struggling to find talent out there in the marketplace,\" said Carlos Cubia, global chief diversity officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance. \"What we do know, from data and research, is that this is the highest unemployed demographic in the country. And that\\'s people with disabilities. So it\\'s an untapped resource that businesses can hopefully turn to.\"\\nOne stumbling block that employers face when hiring neurodiverse individuals is accommodating conditions. Since neurodiversity encompasses such a broad variety of conditions, the accommodations needed also vary broadly. Someone with sensitivity to loud noises may need headphones to muffle the sound. Others with severe dyslexia or other conditions may benefit from signage that includes pictures or is color-coded.\\nSince its start in 2007, Walgreens\\' Transition Work Group program has helped place 1,000 individuals at the company\\'s distribution centers. The 13-week training program includes both classroom and on-the-job training that teaches how to pull and pack orders from the distribution center to stores.\\n\"These individuals, once they come through the 13-week program, they are paid at the same rate as someone without a disability, they have the same expectations in terms of job performance, and are treated just like any employee within the workforce. We don\\'t cut corners to say where you know, your productivity can be less, your expectations or less, we don\\'t do any of that,\" Cubia said.\\nThe company also has a similar program for its retail stores. The Retail Employees with Disabilities trains employees with disabilities to stock shelves, unload trucks, greet customers, or work as a cashier. To keep the program running, Walgreen\\'s HR department and distribution center leadership work with local community organizations as well as state and local social service agencies to help find and screen candidates.\\nJob coaching can be a crucial part of ensuring success. Wawa, which operates a chain of convenience stores and gas stations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and three other states, breaks up tasks for neurodiverse employees. Typical employees have a range of responsibilities from food preparation to cleaning to customer service. A job coach, employed by a coaching organization, not Wawa, will help determine the right scope of tasks for the individual, which can vary depending on their abilities and desires.\\nJay Culotta, treasurer for Wawa and president of The Wawa Foundation, said that when his daughter Hannah, who has Down syndrome, started working for the company two years ago, she worked with a job coach to ensure she was performing tasks efficiently and effectively. \"Over time, as Hannah became more independent, that job coach would start fading away,\" Culotta said.\\nWawa has worked with Eden Autism Services in New Jersey for over 40 years. The partnership started when a store manager hired Ari Shiner, who has autism, through Eden in 1981. Wawa now works with more than 200 different job coaching organizations. Shiner is still with the company and Wawa has about 30 other neurodiverse employees who have stayed on for at least 20 years.\\nWhile some neurodiverse individuals may need more accommodations, many do not.\\n\"The accommodations that are typically needed are not enormous,\" said Dan Roth, a technical recruiter for Amazon who, as someone with ADHD, is also considered neurodiverse. \"If somebody is working at 50% of their capacity, but if you make two or three light accommodations, and that brings them to 85 or 95% ... there, look how much more ROI you\\'re getting,\" he said.\\nAt Go-Be, which employs four neurodiverse individuals, Quinn breaks down tasks to best suit the individual. While her son, Jake, is especially adept with computer-related tasks, another member really enjoys rolling and folding the sleeves. \"It\\'s almost therapeutic for him,\" she said. \"We set up stations for them and we really want to promote their success and give them social opportunities to collaborate with each other to accomplish their role or task,\" Quinn said.\\nWhile there could be some accommodation and investment needed to hire neurodiverse individuals, recruiters and companies that have gone through the process say that there is a payoff — both financial and otherwise.\\n\"These individuals are very reliable, very good from a productivity standpoint … they\\'re very methodical and deliberate about how they do their job attention to detail,\" Cubia said.\\nThe attrition rate for individuals who go through Walgreen\\'s TWG program is 25% lower than the norm in Walgreen\\'s distribution centers. Retention is also higher, Cubia said. \"You\\'ve heard the old adage that it costs less to retain an employee than it does to acquire a new one. It helps you save money from that standpoint,\" he said.\\xa0\\nIn addition, the IRS offers tax credits and incentives to companies that hire disabled individuals, which could include some neurodiverse individuals. Some of the incentives go toward offsetting the cost of accommodations.\\nFor Wawa, the payoff is not necessarily tied to performance metrics or profit margins.\\n\"We have some associates in this program who are just as efficient and productive as our typical associates. . . And we have some that\\'s just not in the cards and that\\'s okay. Their job scope may be very, very narrow or they may work entirely with their job coach,\" said Dave Simonetti, senior director for store operations at Wawa, \"but there\\'s other things that are brought to the table.\"\\nThose other qualities are harder to measure by numbers, but equally important. \"The associates working with them feel that the community really embraces this program. That\\'s a huge win with customer service, which is a huge opportunity in our industry. A lot of times this is a big positive for just customer interaction. It\\'s a different set of metrics,\" he said.\\nWawa has about 47,000 employees, 500 of whom are neurodiverse.\\nWhile companies such as SAP, Microsoft, Ford, Deloitte, IBM and others have shifted their corporate HR practices to bring on more neurodiverse individuals for coding or other technical jobs, efforts to hire neurodiverse individuals for fulfillment, distribution or retail jobs are more scattered. Part of the bias is the perception that neurodiverse individuals or people with disabilities can\\'t keep up in a business that watches performance metrics so closely.\\nArwyn Swanger, a recruiter for Indeed.com and WilsonHCG who focuses on placing neurodiverse individuals, said opportunities for neurodiverse individuals can vary depending on the company, the store and store manager. She cited placing several individuals at Walmart and many at Lowe\\'s. Some store managers are very familiar with the process and any accommodations, others are wary, she said.\\nWalmart spokesperson Jimmy Carter said the company doesn\\'t have a specific program dedicated to hiring neurodiverse individuals. \"We don\\'t inquire about specific conditions but we\\'re committed to engaging, hiring, and growing diverse talent from underrepresented communities, including neurodiverse individuals,\" he said.\\nGo-Be\\'s Quinn hopes that, with greater awareness, more neurodiverse individuals will find employment. The current high rate of unemployment, \"is an alarming number. Moving forward I want to somehow get the community involved,\" she said.\\n\"Those are all great opportunities to help them have a purpose, and that they feel that when they wake up in the morning, they have something to look forward to, and just feel that they\\'re part of society and that they\\'re contributing,\" she added.\\xa0\\xa0\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Small business owners are among the Americans most likely to fall behind on saving for retirement. Investing back into a business is more often a priority for entrepreneurs with any excess cash than investing in a long-term tax-deferred retirement plan. Covid didn\\'t help.\\nAmid the pandemic, scores of America\\'s small business owners stopped or cut back on their retirement savings, according to investment\\xa0professionals and retirement experts, squeezed by rising labor and raw material costs, or in the worst-case scenario, facing business closures.\\nTo be sure, the pandemic didn\\'t take a toll on every small business in terms of retirement planning. Thirty-seven percent of small business owners say they aren\\'t confident that they are saving enough for retirement, according to a March survey by ShareBuilder 401k of 500 small businesses. But that\\'s down somewhat from the 44% who said two years earlier they weren\\'t confident in their retirement savings ability.\\nSome data shows that, at least on the margins, small business owner savings rates mirrored the bump across all Americans during the pandemic. In 2019, the average monthly amount that active participants contributed to their 401(k) plan with Guideline, a retirement platform for small businesses, was $646. That increased to $783 in 2021, according to the company. For its part, Vanguard saw participation rates among small businesses rise to 73% in 2020 from 72% a year earlier, and deferral rates — the portion of an employee\\'s wages contributed to retirement — increase to 7.3% in 2020, up from 7.1% in 2019.\\nBut these outcomes generally don\\'t reflect the experiences of many of the country\\'s smallest businesses — including those in particularly hard-hit industries. Many of these businesses have fallen further behind in their retirement savings goals in recent years for a variety of reasons and are in need of a kick start, according to financial professionals.\\xa0Coupled with the fact that many owners were never\\xa0saving for retirement, the recent market gyrations could make it a good time to consider socking away money, or more money, for\\xa0retirement.\\xa0\\nHere are a few ideas on how to close the gap.\\nGenerally, investing experts suggest saving 10% to 15% of your earnings annually over a 40-year-career — just to maintain the same standard of living at retirement, said Stuart Robertson, CEO of ShareBuilder 401k. Yet the March survey found that only 38% of businesses surveyed were saving 10% or more. Meanwhile, 24% said they were not currently contributing.\\nDavid Peters, founder and owner of Peters Tax Preparation & Consulting in Richmond, Va., has been telling business owners to take a hard look at their budget, paying close attention to where they are spending their money and searching for ways to cut. For instance, they might be able to work at home and save on gas or cut unneeded luxury items. \"A smart move would be to cut some of the current expenses so you can continue to save for the long-term goals,\" he said.\\nAnother option, for those already saving, could be to take on some more investment risk, while also cutting spending, as appropriate. \"If you increase your allocation so you were getting two or three percentage points higher on a rate of return, and you reduce your spending by 2% to 3%, and add on the power of compounding, it can be very powerful for returns,\" said Timothy Speiss, tax partner in the Personal Wealth Advisors Group at EisnerAmper LLP in New York.\\nThat may seem like a tough pill to swallow amid the recent market volatility, but for small business owners that have cash right now, they may be able to take advantage of some funds that could be underpriced. \"People are apprehensive to save when they see the red numbers showing up every day,\" Peters said, but because of the market swings, \"there may be opportunities they wouldn\\'t otherwise have.\"\\nAs Dan Wiener, who runs the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, recently told CNBC\\'s Bob Pisani, when the S&P 500 falls more than 3.5% on a single day or series of days, they are more often than not buying opportunities.\\xa0Between June 1983 and the end of March 2022, this occurred 65 times and produced average returns of 25.6% over the next year.\\xa0\"Buying on those big one-day price declines has been profitable more often than not if you\\'re willing to look out just one year,\" he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile some small business owners may be concerned the market will fall further,\\xa0retirement savings professionals said that things tend to even out over time when owners contribute regularly to their retirement. The underlying motivation shouldn\\'t be to pick the best days, but to create a plan to save for the long-term and stick to it.\\nBy just contributing regularly, investors get the benefits of dollar-cost-averaging, meaning you\\'re not always buying at a high or a low, said Kevin Busque, CEO and co-founder of Guideline. \"When you set it and forget it, you don\\'t have to worry about timing the market.\"\\nRobertson offers the example of an investor who consistently buys a fund for $500, during a high market, low market, and recovering market. First, the investor buys five shares at $100 each. He then buys 10 shares at $50 each, and finally, he purchases 6.67 shares for $75 each. His total outlay is around $1,500, and the average share price for the fund is $75. Yet the total market value for his 21.67 shares is $1625.25, so he\\'s ahead even though he bought some shares at a market high and some at a market low.\\n\"They can save any way they want; the important thing is that they are doing it,\" Robertson said.\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Brex, the Silicon Valley lender to start-ups, is dropping tens of thousands of small business customers to focus on bigger venture-backed clients, according to co-founder Henrique Dubugras.\\nThe company began informing customers this week that they have until Aug. 15 to withdraw funds from online accounts and find new providers, Dubugras told CNBC on Friday in a Zoom interview. Axios reported the change Thursday.\\nThe move is the latest sign of a sea change occurring among start-ups as an abrupt shift in market conditions is forcing a new discipline on companies that previously focused purely on growth. The shift began late last year, when the shares of high-flying publicly traded fintech players such as PayPal began to collapse.\\nDubugras said that he and his co-founder Pedro Franceschi made the decision in December as their start-up customers became increasingly demanding. Plunging valuations for public companies soon bled over into the private realm, hammering valuations for pre-IPO companies and forcing firms to focus on profitability.\\nThat meant that some of Brex\\'s biggest customers began to request solutions to help them control expenses and hire cheaper international workers, Dubugras said.\\nAt the same time, the traditional brick-and-mortar small businesses, including retailers and restaurants, that Brex began adding in a 2019 expansion flooded support lines, resulting in worse service for the start-ups they valued more, he said.\\n\"We got to a situation where we realized that if we didn\\'t choose one, we would do a poor job for both\" groups of clients, he said. \"So we decided to focus on our core customer that are the start-ups that are growing.\"\\nThe initial news of the announcement caused mass confusion among Brex customers, spurring Franceschi to tweet about the move, Dubugras said.\\nBrex is holding onto clients that have secured institutional backing of any kind, including from accelerator programs, angel investors or Web 3.0 tokens, he said. They are also keeping traditional companies that Brex deems midmarket in size, which have \"more financial history so we can underwrite them for our credit card,\" Dubugras said.\\nThe shift is the latest learning moment for the two young co-founders, Stanford University dropouts who took Silicon Valley by storm when they created Brex in 2017. The company was one of the fastest to reach unicorn status and was last valued at $12.3 billion.\\nThe pair mistakenly thought that expanding services to more traditional small businesses would be a simple move. Instead, the needs of the two cohorts were different, requiring a different set of products, he said.\\n\"We built Brex with 20 people, so we thought, why can\\'t we just build a different Brex with another 20 people?\" Dubugras said. \"I learned that focus is extremely important; that\\'s definitely a lesson I\\'m going to take with me forever.\"\\nWhile business leaders have been warning of an impending recession in recent weeks, the decision wasn\\'t based on concern that small businesses would default on corporate cards, the co-founder said. That\\'s because most small businesses had to repay their cards on a daily basis, leaving little risk Brex wouldn\\'t get repaid, he said.\\n\"It\\'s terrible. It\\'s the worst outcome for us, too,\" Dubugras said. \"We invested so much money in acquiring these customers, serving them, building the brand, all these things.\"\\nBrex ranked No. 2 on this year\\'s CNBC Disruptor 50 list.

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nThe U.S. economy is going through one of the most difficult periods I\\'ve seen in my 40-year career. Inflation, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions — all of them are hitting big business hard and small businesses even harder.\\nAnd so this week, at Goldman Sachs\\'\\xa010,000 Small Businesses\\xa0summit in Washington, D.C., I\\'ll be joining leaders from across the country to call for action. The pandemic created a slew of new challenges for small businesses, but the federal programs they rely on aren\\'t well-equipped to help. It\\'s time to give those programs an upgrade so small businesses have the tools they need to navigate the turmoil ahead.\\nAnd rather than pass these reforms one by one, Congress should put them together in a single legislative package: the first reauthorization of the Small Business Administration (SBA) in over 20 years.\\nNow, it\\'s true small businesses got a lot of help during the early days of the pandemic. It was only last year that Congress passed the American Rescue Plan, which provided grants and loans to millions of small businesses so they could keep their doors open and their employees on their payrolls.\\nBut now that the economy is running hot, the recovery is in danger. According to a recent survey of 1,533 graduates of Goldman Sachs\\' business education program,\\xa010,000 Small Businesses, 93 percent are concerned that the United States will enter a recession within the next year. Eighty-nine percent of small business owners say economic trends like inflation, supply chain issues, and workforce challenges are having a negative effect on their business. Eighty percent say inflationary pressures have risen in the last three months and 75 percent say inflation is hurting their businesses\\' financial health.\\nWe already have a wide range of federal programs designed to help, but they need to be reformed to address the challenges ahead. Congress can lend a hand by taking action on the following four issues.\\xa0\\nFirst, small businesses are struggling to find and keep good workers. Lawmakers should consider new programs to help small business compete with big business to retain and develop talent. For example, Congress could enhance paid leave programs and create new tax credits to support small businesses\\' hiring and retention efforts.\\nSecond, the pandemic not only increased the need for capital but also starkly exposed gaps in credit markets, especially for Black-owned small businesses. According to Goldman Sachs survey data, 48 percent of Black small business owners say they expect to take out a loan or line of credit for their business in 2022 — yet just 19% are \"very confident\" in their businesses\\' ability to access capital. And so Congress should strengthen the capacity of Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to provide more credit to small businesses in underserved communities.\\xa0\\nThird, child care is one of the most significant economic vulnerabilities highlighted by the pandemic. According to Goldman Sachs survey data, 80 percent of small business owners support Congress increasing access to affordable child care. Congress could help by expanding and enhancing programs designed to lower the cost of child care and increasing access in what are known as \"childcare deserts\" across the country.\\xa0\\nFourth, the barriers to entry for small businesses looking to win contracts with the federal government are too high. From 2010 to 2019, the number of small businesses providing common products and services to the federal government shrank by 38 percent. Even more alarming, the number of new small-business entrants into the federal procurement marketplace fell by 79 percent.\\nThe federal government already has goals for the share of contracts awarded to various types of small businesses, including those owned by women and those located in historically underutilized business zones (HUBZones). Yet the women-owned small businesses federal contracting goal has been met just twice since it was established in 1994 and the HUBZone goal has never been met.\\nA modernized SBA could help set things right. Congress should level the playing field by streamlining processes and widening the scope of procurement opportunities, particularly for minority- and women-owned small businesses.\\nAll of these reforms would go a long way toward making small businesses as resilient and tenacious as ever. Despite the challenges they face, 65% of small business owners remain optimistic about the financial trajectory of their business this year. With a modernized SBA, and other efforts from policymakers, Congress can help ensure that small businesses remain pillars of our economy and local communities.\\nThe path ahead will be bumpy, no doubt, but if there\\'s one thing I know, it\\'s that you should never bet against America. It\\'s our entrepreneurial spirit that drives the most resilient economy in the world. And if the public and private sector work together, we can make sure small business owners have the tools they need to keep the economy on course.\\xa0\\n—By David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'The federal government awarded $154.2 billion to small businesses in fiscal year 2021, an $8 billion increase from the previous fiscal year, according to data from the Small Business Administration released Tuesday.\\nThat\\'s a record 27.2% of total federal contracting funds, exceeding the government\\'s goal of 23%.\\n\"We are excited to see that more dollars and a larger percentage are going to small businesses,\" said SBA Administrator Isabel Guzman, adding that several of the changes President Biden has announced since taking office are starting to take hold. These efforts are aimed at leveling the playing field for small businesses competing for federal contracts, an area where many have struggled.\\nStill, there\\'s work to be done. The number of small businesses receiving prime contracts fell again in fiscal 2021, continuing a multi-year trend. The most recent data show that 71,441 small businesses received contracts, down 5.7% from 75,726 in fiscal year 2020.\\xa0\\xa0\\nBy contrast, about 125,000 small businesses contracted with the federal government in fiscal year 2010, according to a report by The National Equity Atlas, produced by PolicyLink and the USC Equity Research Institute (ERI) that used SBA data.\\nSmall business advocates cite several reasons for the difficulty small businesses face in procuring government contracts. Part of the problem is due to competition from larger, more established businesses that have more experience, said Shane McCall, equity partner at Koprince McCall Pottroff who works with small businesses. There can also be procedural headaches and statutory requirements that prevent some businesses from applying in the first place, he said.\\nThe federal government\\'s bonding requirements, in particular, tend to disproportionately impact disadvantaged business enterprises, said Judith Dangerfield, a senior fellow at PolicyLink, a national research and action institute focused on advancing economic and social equity. These business owners must overcome the same bias — the notion that race equals risk — that they face in banking and finance, she said. \"As a result, bonding has been a barrier to participation for DBE firms for decades,\" she said.\\nGuzman said she is encouraged by the positive developments in the past fiscal year. Notably, 21 of the 24 agencies monitored by the SBA received an \"A+\" or \"A\" rating on its scorecard.\\nThe 11 agencies to receive an \"A+\" grade are: The Department of Commerce, The Department of Homeland Security, The Department of Labor, The Department of State, The Department of the Interior, The Environmental Protection Agency, The General Services Administration, The National Science Foundation, The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, The Office of Personnel Management and The Small Business Administration.\\nTen agencies received an \"A\" grade: The Agency for International Development, The Department of Agriculture, The Department of Defense, The Department of Education,\\u202fThe Department of Energy, The Department of Justice, The Department of Transportation, The Department of Veterans Affairs, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Social Security Administration.\\u202f\\xa0\\xa0\\nStill, it\\'s by no means a perfect system, especially for women-owned small businesses and those located in historically underutilized business zones (HUBZones). The women-owned small businesses federal contracting goal has been met just twice since it was established in 1994 and the HUBZone goal has never been met, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote in a recent op-ed for CNBC in which he voiced the bank\\'s support for the first reauthorization by Congress of the SBA in over two decades to provide it with more ability to support small business.\\nIn 2021, women-owned small businesses received $26.2 billion in federal contracts, representing 4.63% of the fiscal year 2021 total eligible dollars, the SBA said. The goal was 5%.\\nHUBZone small businesses, meanwhile, received a historic $14.3 billion in federal contract awards, translating into 2.53% of the fiscal year 2021 total eligible dollars. It\\'s the highest level in about 10 years, Guzman said, but still falls short of the government\\'s 3% statutory goal.\\xa0\\nWhile the agency didn\\'t meet these goals, Guzman said \"they are still on the horizon.\"\\nFor women-owned businesses, SBA has increased the number of certified firms to nearly 6,000 from about 1,000. It has also expanded the NAICS codes, the classification system used by the government for business categories, for which women-owned businesses can receive set-aside awards. More than 92% of federal spending is covered by NAICS codes eligible for WOSB (Women Owned Small Businesses) set-aside awards, according to the SBA.\\nThe SBA is also continuing to work on helping HUBZone businesses compete for federal contracts. In 2020, the agency simplified rules to help these businesses compete more effectively. Guzman said the agency aims to do \"expanded outreach and make sure more businesses know about the simplified rules.\"\\nHelping small businesses obtain more federal contracts has been a goal of President Biden. Notably, small disadvantaged business spending reached 11% for the first time, according to the new SBA data. The target is to hit 15% of federal contracts by 2025.\\nLate last year, the White House announced\\xa0key reforms\\xa0to promote more equitable buying practices. One example is the effort to reform the federal government\\'s use of \"category management,\" which has contributed to the consolidation of contracting dollars, said Eliza McCullough, an associate at PolicyLink. The practice allows federal agencies to buy contracts as an organized entity, rather than as thousands of independent buyers. This helps to eliminate redundant buying choices, but an unintended result is that small, disadvantaged businesses receive a proportionally lower share of contracts, she said.\\nReforms to mitigate the inequities include giving agencies automatic \"credit\" under category management for all awards made to small, disadvantaged businesses and strengthening the voice for small business equity considerations in category management governance, McCullough said.\\n\"Along with increased investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other institutions that serve communities of color to uplift the next generation of Black-, Latinx-, and Tribal-owned small businesses, these reforms democratize access to federal contracts and foster inclusive business development,\" McCullough said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday, the latest in a series of rate hikes intended to cool the economy and bring down inflation. For all Americans, higher interest rates carry weighty financial implications. Main Street business owners are no exception, as the higher interest rates will flow through to the cost of business loans from lenders including national, regional and community banks, as well as the Small Business Administration\\'s key 7(a) loan program.\\nEven more significant may be how the economic slowdown being engineered by the Fed influences consumer demand and the growth outlook for Main Street. With the odds of recession mounting as a result, at least partially, of the recent series of Fed rate hikes, the cost to be paid by Main Street isn\\'t limited to a bigger monthly debt interest payment and higher cost on new loans. The biggest issue is a business lending market that may quickly dry up as banks pull back on loans to conserve capital and limit risk, and an increasingly smaller percentage of business owners meet stricter credit requirements.\\nThe Federal Reserve is likely not done yet with its rate hikes after the Wednesday decision, with additional increases expected again in September and later in 2022. Here is what small business lending experts say entrepreneurs should be thinking about as they face both higher lending costs and the risk of a slower-growing economy.\\nInterest rates for business loans, at one point last year, dipped below 4%. That didn\\'t last, and the average small business loan is on its way to as high as 8%,\\xa0but it is important to remember that borrowing costs remain very low relative to history. Another 75 basis points from the Fed is not insignificant, and it will flow through the bank lending market.\\n\"When the Fed starts hiking it has a ripple effect across all interest rate indices,\" said Chris Hurn, the founder and CEO of Fountainhead, which specializes in small business lending.\\nBut Hurn noted that with the historically low rates, the monthly interest payments made by business owners shouldn\\'t be impacted as much as the headlines might otherwise suggest. A small business owner taking on debt for a $200,000 piece of equipment, for example, will pay a little extra a month — more or less depending on the loan amortization period — but for most loans the increase in monthly interest should not be a major cash flow issue.\\n\"A few hundred basis points, people can withstand,\" Hurn said.\\n\"Most business owners look at that monthly amount and they can support that 75 basis points,\" said Rohit Arora, co-founder and CEO of Biz2Credit, which focuses on small business lending. \"It\\'s not that significant on a 10-year loan,\" he added.\\nThe biggest way that the higher rates may hurt small business is in the overall economic and market effect.\\nThe Fed needs to cool the economy to bring inflation down. In some ways, that should help small businesses manage costs, including labor and inventory.\\n\"Ultimately, business owners understand it\\'s the greater good,\" Hurn said. \"They can\\'t keep raising wages for employees and have higher inventory costs, and pass them along to customers. The Fed has to do something ... and if it is a little more expensive ... I do believe it will be for a relatively short period. ... I think they can hold their nose and swallow hard and accept it as a condition of tamping down inflation,\" he said.\\nIn fact, Wall Street expects the Fed to begin cutting rates again as soon as March 2023 based on expectations for a much weaker economy. But that economic outlook will be the big driver of borrowing trends.\\n\"Banks get worried, and the number of people eligible for loans goes down,\" Hurn said.\\nHe has seen this play out multiple times in his over two decades as a lender, as banks and credit unions get increasingly tighter when it comes to making business loans as uncertainty in the economy increases. Banks effectively \"go to the sidelines,\" he said.\\nWhile recent data shows business loan approval rates basically unchanged month over month, the credit policies at banks, from community banks to regional and national banks, are already tightening as the economy moves closer to a recession.\\n\"That is occurring and it will accelerate,\" Hurn said.\\nBanks and financial institutions are in a much better position now than they were in 2008.\\n\"More will be weathering the storm, but will pull back on financing expansion,\" he said.\\nBusiness owners should expect to see the debt service coverage ratios — the operating income available to service all debt principal and interest — increase from what has recently been as low as 1.25 to as high as 1.5.\\nMany business \"won\\'t be able to hit those numbers,\" Hurn said. \"And that is what always occurs when we are in a cycle like this.\"\\nArora said more restrictive debt terms, known as covenants, are starting to be put back into deals, and as the economy pulls back, business owners should expect to see more of this from banks over the remainder of the year and into 2023.\\nThe fact that banks will be stricter on loans doesn\\'t mean the need for growth capital is declining.\\nSmall business lending demand has been down for a good reason, with many business owners already helped by the Paycheck Protection Program and SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But demand has been increasing just as rates started going up, in a similar fashion to consumers running through their pandemic stimulus savings yet also running into tighter lending conditions.\\nLoans made through the SBA 7(a) loan program tend to be slightly more expensive than average bank loans, but that difference will be outweighed by the availability of debt as banks slow their lending. Currently, bank loans are in the range of 6% to 8% while the SBA loans run a little higher, in the range of 7% to 9%.\\nWhen the banks aren\\'t lending, the SBA loan program will see more activity, which SBA lenders Fountainhead and Biz2Credit say is already happening.\\n\"We\\'re already seeing the shift in volume,\" Arora said. \"Our volume has been going up over the past three to four weeks,\" he added.\\nMost small business loans made through the Small Business Administration 7(a) loan program are variable, meaning the interest rate resets every 90 days in response to movement in the prime rate, and the total interest rate is a combination of the prime rate plus a maximum 2.75% additional SBA rate. Federal Reserve rate hikes send the prime rate higher, and that in turn means the monthly interest payments on existing debt through the 7(a) program will soon be higher. The price of any new loans will be based on the new prime rate as well.\\nApproximately 90% of SBA 7(a) loans are variable, prime rate plus the SBA spread, and of those loan types, 90% or more adjust on a quarterly basis as the prime rate adjusts.\\nWhile much of the expected interest rate increases are already priced into bank loans, the SBA loan lag means as individual business owners come up on a 90-day rolling window for an interest rate reset, they should expect a higher monthly payment. But that\\'s common in the world of SBA loans and given the lengthy amortization schedules — 10 years for working capital and equipment and as long as 25 years for real estate — the difference won\\'t be great.\\nIf SBA loans were in the range of 5% to 6% last fall, now business owners are looking at 7.5% to low 8%, and that is for loans that are typically 50 basis points to 75 basis points higher than bank loans.\\n\"The bigger advantages are having longer amortizations, a longer time to pay back the loan, so it doesn\\'t influence cash flow as much month to month, and less covenants,\" Hurn said.\\nThe increased interest in SBA loans should last for a while, but Arora said that another 250 basis points in Fed rate hikes and that overall demand will start to dampen. The latest Wall Street forecasts anticipate two more hikes from the Fed this year after Wednesday, with a potential total hike of 75 basis points more across multiple FOMC meetings — 50 in September and 25 later in the year. That\\'s 150 basis points including Wednesday\\'s FOMC decision, and when factoring in the 150 points of tightening made earlier in 2022, a total of 300 basis points in higher lending costs.\\nIn taking the benchmark overnight borrowing rate up to a range of 2.25%-2.5% on Wednesday, the consecutive 75 basis point hikes in June and July represent the most aggressive moves since the Fed began using the overnight funds rate as the principal tool of monetary policy in the early 1990s, and took rates back up to where they last peaked in 2019.\\nWhen banks tighten, minority and women-owned small businesses suffer in a disproportionate manner.\\nAside longstanding institutional barriers to accessing capital, some of the reasons come down to a business profile among these owners which leads banks to be tougher on them. According to Arora, women and minority-owned businesses tend to be smaller, have less cash flow and less history of servicing debt, and lower margins, which at a time of greater economic pressure makes margins even more vulnerable. They also tend to be concentrated in more sensitive sectors of the economy, smaller retail operations, for example, rather than health care or IT companies. Banks, therefore, are more likely to lend to more established firms able to meet higher debt service coverage ratios.\\n\"That happens in every recession and they have to borrow more expensive debt to stay afloat,\" Arora said.\\xa0\\nOn the plus side, debt already granted through the PPP and EIDL programs has helped to lower the overall debt needs compared to what they would traditionally be at this point in the economic cycle. And their ability to manage cash flow during the pandemic and make payments means they are coming into the slowdown in a better position to access debt, at least compared to history.\\nThe mortgage market has been the primary example of how quickly sentiment can shift, even when rates remain low relative to history, with homebuyer demand declining rapidly as mortgage rates have gone up. For business owners, the decision should be different and not based solely on the interest rate.\\nBusiness owners need to make a calculated decision on whether to take on debt, and that should be based on analysis of the opportunity to grow. Higher cost debt, and a slight drag on margins, is a price that a business should be willing to pay if top line growth is there for the long-term.\\nArora says the most likely determinant right now is what happens with consumer demand and the macroeconomy. The lack of visibility in 2008 led many business owners to pull back on debt. Now, an 8% to 9% interest rate on a loan isn\\'t as big a factor as whether their sales outlook is improving, their average bill going up or down, and their ability to find workers improving or worsening.\\n\"They shouldn\\'t mind taking the hit on the bottom line if they can see where it\\'s going, helping to gain more new clients and pay bills, and stock up on inventory ahead of the holidays,\" Arora said.\\nThe recent slowdown in commodities inflation, led by gas prices, should help buoy consumer demand and, in turn, improve cash flow for business owners. But Arora said the next major trend in business loan activity will depend on whether demand stays strong. The majority of small business owners expect a recession to start this year, and will be looking for signs of confirmation.\\nThe Fed said in its statement on Wednesday that while recent indicators of spending and production have softened, the job market remains strong and unemployment low. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his press conference that he does not think the economy is in a recession, but that as the central bank continues to tighten, it would at some point \"become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation.\"\\n\"Big demand destruction into the holiday season and then they won\\'t be borrowing,\" Arora said.\\xa0\"What they [small businesses] cannot live with is very steep demand destruction.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'For many small businesses, access to funding can be a matter of life and death.\\xa0\\nThe stakes are especially high given that 18.4% of U.S. businesses fail within the first year, 49.7% after five years and 65.5% after 10 years, according to a LendingTree analysis of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. One of the top reasons businesses go under is lack of funding, so it\\'s especially important to know where to turn if you need a lifeline.\\xa0\\nWhile the options can depend on factors such as size, industry, amount needed, time frame and purpose, here are eight possibilities to consider:\\nThis can be a great place to turn because it doesn\\'t generally come with a lot of financial background requirements or other pre-requisites. \"Uncle Charlie is going to be more willing to believe in you without requiring extensive financial documentation,\" said Joshua Oberndorf, a manager in the private business services group at EisnerAmper.\\nPros: Easier access to needed funds without high interest rates.\\nCons: Failure to pay back the funds in a timely manner, or reneging completely, could sour family relationships. \"Money is as much accounting as it is psychological,\" Oberndorf said.\\nWhat else to know: According to the IRS, family members are supposed to charge a minimum interest rate to avoid adverse gift tax consequences. The IRS publishes these Applicable Federal Rates (AFRs) on a monthly basis.\\nPros: Trusted and well-established source of funding. May be lower cost than other options and offers the ability to grow the lending and banking relationship over time.\\nCons: Banks can have rigid lending requirements, including a good personal credit score and\\xa0ample cash flow and income, that may be out-of-reach for some credit borrowers, and the process can be slow, sometimes several weeks to secure a loan.\\nWhat else to know: Rates can range from around 3% to about 7%, according to LendingTree. Consider a smaller bank, which may be more willing to grant credit and walk you through some of your options, said Matt Barbieri, a certified public accountant with Wiss & Co., who provides business advisory services.\\nPros: Offers quick access to capital, generally through a simple, online process.\\nCons: It can be hard to discern actual cost of capital, especially with a merchant cash advance, which is an upfront sum that a business is on the hook to repay using a percentage of debit and credit card sales, plus a fee. Some online lenders and funders may not have long-standing track records, and the option may be more expensive than others. An online loan, for instance, has an APR of between 7% and 99%, whereas the approximate APR of a merchant cash advance runs between 40% and 350%, according to NerdWallet.\\nWhat else to know: Do your due diligence on any online lender or funder you plan to use, said Craig Palubiak, president of Optim Consulting Group. Make sure the company has a good reputation and multiple good reviews, and be sure to compare multiple options. It\\'s also important to drill down to the total cost of capital, taking into account the interest rate, if applicable, fees, and early payment penalties, if any.\\nFor help understanding the true cost of a merchant cash advance, use an online calculator.\\xa0\\xa0\\nPros: Federal-backing provides access to low-rate bank financing for small and large loans. There are different types of loans and lenders and programs have unique eligibility requirements. Resource centers are available to help business owners, including those in underserved communities.\\nCons: The approval process can be slow. The timeline depends on the loan, but generally it can take a few months. A down payment or collateral may be required. Low-credit applicants may not be approved.\\nWhat else to know: There are different types of SBA loans, and maximums vary. The most common SBA loan type is called 7(a), and you might expect to pay somewhere in the range of 7% to 9.5%.\\xa0\"Be prepared to work on a refinance as soon as the agreement allows,\" Barbieri said. This will allow you to remove personal guarantees and restrictive covenants that can stifle growth, he said. An SBA loan may offer a longer repayment term — under the 7(a) program, up to 10 years for equipment and working capital; 25 years for real estate — and may offer competitive interest rates compared with conventional bank loans.\\nPros: Quick access to capital with the possibility of rewards. It could be a good option for\\xa0short-term funding needs, if you are certain you can pay off the debt before interest starts to accrue. Business cards tend to carry higher credit limits than personal cards.\\nCons: Interest rates can be high. Cards that are well-ranked by Creditcards.com offer APRs in the range of close to 10% to nearly 35%, and some cards charge an annual fee. Generally not a good option for large funding needs.\\nWhat else to know: \"Don\\'t rely on this as a sole source for funding growth; if you are too high risk for the other categories, seriously consider that before taking on consumer credit as a business,\" Barbieri said.\\nPrivate grants, private equity and individuals with money to invest can serve as sources of funding.\\xa0\\nPros: Positive cash flow, as well as expertise to help propel the business forward.\\xa0\\nCons: Dilution of capital, difficult to find the right match.\\xa0\\nWhat else to know: Palubiak recommends owners tap their network and affiliate with start-up communities and local organizations to make investor connections.\\n\"Spend as long as you can dating before picking your mate,\" Barbieri said. \"Make sure their goals are aligned with your goals or it will end badly.\"\\nPros: Typically non-dilutive, can be small or large.\\nCons: There can be administrative hassles and restrictive eligibility requirements.\\xa0\\nWhat else to know: This could be a good option if you are a company that can be deemed \"important\" to the infrastructure of your region, Barbieri said. Start your research by researching resources on the website of the U.S. Economic Development Administration to find EDA regional office contacts, state government contacts and other information.\\xa0\\nPros: Allows you access to capital without piling on debt, and the ability to raise money and increase awareness of your brand among potential investors and customers while test-marketing an idea.\\nCons: May have a low success rate. Could be fees associated with certain platforms. Also, launching a successful campaign takes marketing resources and time.\\nWhat else to know: There are a growing number of available equity crowdfunding websites. Before choosing a provider, make sure you understand how the platform works, the fees, who can invest and how it could accomplish your specific funding needs.\\nSIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

Others don\\'t want to spend the money or simply don\\'t realize the importance of having an objective third-party measure of its worth.\\xa0\\nA valuation, however, can be critical for many reasons. These include an impending sale,\\xa0 the issuance of stock options, succession planning, tax and estate planning, capital raising, implementing a buy-sell agreement, insurance needs or to obtain business funding, said Robert King, partner on the investment banking team at Crewe.\\xa0\\nSay, for instance, you want to gift company shares to a family member. Understanding the company\\'s valuation is important for tax and estate-planning purposes. Another reason to value the business is as a checkpoint so partners are all on the same page. Even if there\\'s a buy-sell agreement, there can be disputes over how a business is valued for the purposes of separation. Having realistic expectations for the business along the way can prevent a prolonged and messy fight over the company\\'s worth if the time does come for owners to part ways, Harms said.\\nKnowing your business\\'s up-to-date worth is also important because many owners don\\'t plan to sell their business until a suitor comes knocking, said Brett Dearing, partner and exit planning specialist with the wealth management firm Cerity Partners. If you don\\'t have a current valuation, you\\'ll be at a disadvantage from a negotiation standpoint. You could either have an overly rosy outlook for your business, or conversely, be grossly underestimating its potential.\\xa0\\n\"A lot of business owners don\\'t understand the value of their business before they sit down with a buyer at the negotiating table,\" Dearing said.\\nOne of the best ways to find an expert to value your business is through one of three credentialing bodies.\\nThe Accredited in Business Valuation credential is granted by The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to CPAs and qualified valuation professionals who meet the requirements. There\\'s also a business valuation certification by the American Society of Appraisers. And the National Association of Certified Valuators and Analysts offers the Certified Valuation Analyst designation.\\nWhile having one of these certifications alone doesn\\'t guarantee an appraiser\\'s quality, it should be your baseline starting point given the level of expertise these designations require, business valuation professionals said.\\nThere\\'s no single answer to the question of cost because it depends largely on the size and complexity of the business, the scope of work required, and the purpose and intended use of the valuation, Harms said.\\nGiven these parameters, an appraisal could cost anywhere from around $5,000 to around $50,000, according to valuation professionals. Be sure to be specific with the appraiser about the reasons you are seeking a valuation so they deliver what you\\'re asking for.\\xa0\\nSome of the assumptions that go into a valuation for estate planning purposes or issuance of equity compensation could be decidedly different than for raising capital or selling a business, said King. \"One size does not fit all,\" he said.\\nDepending on what you need the valuation for, it can be something you do annually or every few years.\\xa0\\nIt can also be done more frequently as you are trying to grow your business. M&T Bank offers a free digital platform that allows businesses to model how different outcomes would impact their valuation. It\\'s not an accredited valuation, but the service offers a baseline before you take that next step, said Jonathan Kolozsvary, director of new ventures at M&T Bank.\\xa0\\nValuing the business regularly can help you determine weak spots and make improvements. \"If you go through the valuation process and the value isn\\'t quite where you want it to be, you can improve the valuation based on the areas identified,\" said Tami M. Bolder, director at CBIZ Valuation Group. \"It\\'s also helpful for general planning purposes,\" she said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'With recessionary winds whirling, many small business owners have already cut back, but more trimming may be needed to weather the economic storm that\\'s brewing.\\nU.S. economic growth fell 0.9% in the second quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Thursday, the second consecutive quarter of negative GDP. That will ratchet up fears that the economy has entered a recession, though it is not technically an accepted definition for that change in the economic cycle. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday he did not think the economy was in a recession.\\nSome small businesses have already been paring back, based on signals of a slowdown. A report released Thursday by the finance automation platform Ramp found that small business spending on electronics dropped by 59% between May and June. Many small businesses spent 28% less on shipping, 14% less on advertising and 11% on SaaS and software purchases over the same time period, the report showed.\\n\"I advise my clients and followers on social media to pull back on all unnecessary spending to see what the economy brings with it in the second half,\" said Brian Moran, chief executive of Small Business Edge, which provides guidance to small enterprises.\\xa0\\nFinding ways to trim fat without cutting into the meat of the business is a challenge for many owners. Here are three tips for surviving a recessionary environment.\\nOwners don\\'t always know precisely what they are spending money on, so doing a self-audit is the first order of business. Use the last three bank and credit card statements to identify areas where you can make small, but meaningful cuts, said Carissa Reiniger, founder and chief executive of Silver Lining, which advises and lends to small businesses.\\nFor instance, your business may have subscriptions to periodicals, apps, software or networking groups that are unused or underutilized. These costs can really pile up, especially if you\\'re paying on a per-head basis. Also look at other recurring expenses, including phone services, utilities and bank account fees to see where you can cut back or eliminate certain costs, she said.\\xa0\\n\"I think the average small business could reduce their expenses by 20% without feeling a pinch,\" Reiniger said. Don\\'t be afraid to negotiate. Especially in turbulent economic times, small businesses have more negotiating power, she said.\\nDavid Quinn, chief financial officer of banking fintech Bluevine, said small businesses should also negotiate with suppliers. When having these discussions, consider whether there is\\xa0something else you can offer to your supplier that others are not. Also think about whether there is a deal you can establish that will help both sides, he said. Some suppliers may not be willing to broker a deal, but in that case, there may be other options to shave costs, such as discounts for bulk purchasing, he said.\\nParing back on upfront expenditures can also be a prudent move. Peter Shieh, senior wealth advisor at Citi Global Wealth, has a client in the commercial lighting business who in the past might have kept six to nine months of inventory like bulbs and electric wires. Now the client is ordering three months ahead, at the most. The client also negotiated with suppliers to lock in rates for certain products. \"With inflation, prices could be 20% to 30% higher in three months, so that\\'s another thing they are thinking and planning for,\" Shieh said.\\nOne tactic to conserve cash could be to pay bills closer to when they are due, versus 15 or 20 days in advance, or asking for a longer payment window, say 60 to 90 days, instead of 30 days.\\nAlso look at real estate costs, said Matt Armanino, chief executive and managing partner of Armanino LLP, an independent accounting and business consulting firm. If your lease is up soon, consider whether you really need the footprint you have, given the trend toward hybrid or remote work. Or, if it\\'s a long-term lease, is there an option to sublease a portion of the space?\\nFor most small businesses, employee-related costs are a top expense, so it\\'s an easy place to attempt to shave costs. Don\\'t jump the gun. The cost to hire and retain talent is particularly high now, so letting people go unless you really have to can be \"penny wise and pound foolish,\" Armanino said.\\nIf you\\'ve tried other avenues and still need to curb costs, consider furloughing workers rather than firing them outright, said Joshua Oberndorf, a CPA at EisnerAmper. Let them know how valuable they are to your business and your intention to bring them back as soon as possible, he said.\\nYou might also consider taking out a small business line of credit you can use as a short-term bridge, Shieh said. For this option, a small business might expect an APR of between 7% and 25%, on average, according to NerdWallet\\'s Fundera. Although rates are higher now than, say, six months ago, it\\'s good to have the lifeline to access if necessary, he said. There are also other options for small business funding, including friends and family, online lenders or funders and SBA loans.\\nLook to see what portions of the business can be automated or digitized. Maybe, for instance, you can deploy a chatbot to reduce customer service costs or switch to online training versus onsite. Armanino\\'s firm, for example, did the latter and the move paid off within a few quarters.\\xa0\\nSometimes you have to spend a little money upfront to achieve longer-term cost savings, he said. This is true, even in a downturn, especially if the cash you\\'re spending elsewhere can be redeployed for these purposes, he said.\\nThere\\'s a temptation among many small businesses to stop marketing activities in a downturn. Don\\'t fall into this trap. Consider a study by McGraw-Hill Research that analyzed 600 companies from 1980 through 1985. The results showed that companies who stayed the course with marketing spending during two years of recession significantly boosted sales. And by 1985, those that had advertised aggressively during the recession had substantially higher sales than those that let advertising fall by the wayside.\\n\"You don\\'t want to shut down communications with customers; that\\'s your future revenue,\" Oberndorf said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Small business confidence has hit an all-time low as the majority of Main Street expects runaway inflation and a Federal Reserve that is incapable of engineering a soft landing for the economy, leading to revenue declines and staffing cuts across sectors.\\nThe majority of small business owners (57%) taking part in the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q3 2022 think the recession has already begun, while another 14% predict recession before the end of the year.\\nThe CNBC/SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted July 25-31, 2022 among a national sample of 2,557 self-identified small business owners.\\nThe pessimism on Main Street is more widespread than in the general population, according to the survey, which included a companion poll of nearly 12,000 non-business owners. Among this group, 45% believe the U.S. economy has entered a recession.\\nThe CNBC|SurveyMonkey data is in line with other polling of the small business community.\\n\"Outlook for business conditions in our monthly survey has deteriorated quite a bit from the beginning of the year,\" said Holly Wade, executive director of research at the National Federation of Independent Business, speaking at CNBC\\'s Small Business Playbook virtual summit on Wednesday.\\nWhile inflation in input costs, energy prices and labor have been a top concern for small business owners throughout the year, its dominance in the minds of entrepreneurs continues to climb. According to the Q3 survey, 43% of small business owners say inflation is the biggest risk to their business right now, up again from last quarter, when it was 38%, and the highest this reading has reached in the past four quarters of surveys.\\n\"It certainly ramped up since the beginning of the year, and most don\\'t see much end in sight or easing of this problem,\" Wade said.\\nMore than three-quarters (77%) of small business owners polled expect prices to continue going up. And while many large corporations continue to pass along price increases to customers and report healthy profits, only 13% of small businesses said now is a good time to raise prices.\\n\"Their No. 1 tool in dealing with inflation, those higher input costs, is passing along those costs to the customer. Unfortunately, a lot of times, they\\'re not able to do that immediately. So it\\'s really hurting cash flow and making managing cash flow really difficult and impacting earnings,\" Wade said.\\nOnly a minority of small business owners (26%) have confidence in the Federal Reserve to successfully battle inflation — a finding that is consistent with the Q2 survey results.\\nThe Fed has continued to message inflation as its top priority and that interest rates will continue to increase until it has prices under control, but Fed senior leadership including Chair Jerome Powell have said they do not believe the economy is in a recession.\\n\"We\\'re not in a recession right now. ... To some extent, a recession is in the eyes of the beholder,\" St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC on Wednesday.\\nGDP has been negative for two consecutive quarters, a recession indicator based on history, but by some measures, the U.S. economy is proving resilient. While big box stores have been hit hard by shifting consumer behavior, overall consumer spending levels are still high. The labor market is strong, unemployment is low, and the latest macroeconomic data has given more support to the belief that recession may be avoided. The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing managers index, released Wednesday,\\xa0showed a surprise rebound. The stock market, meanwhile, just turned in its best month since 2020.\\nEconomists say that small business sentiment, similar to consumer sentiment, tends to be reactive rather than based on longer-term forecasting, and that can result in sharper, shorter-term shifts in sentiment. The current recession view on Main Street, as captured by the Small Business Survey, differs significantly from the Fed view. But in the details that make up the core confidence index, there is more general reflection of the economic slowdown that the Fed is attempting to engineer and that more optimistic economists call a soft landing.\\nAccording to SurveyMonkey, which conducts the poll for CNBC, nearly every index component worsened quarter-over-quarter, but the confidence indicator that looms largest this quarter is a weaker sales outlook on Main Street. As the Fed attempts to cool demand throughout the economy with higher interest rates, over one-quarter (28%) of small business owners expect their revenue to decrease over the next 12 months, up from 21% last quarter. This was the biggest swing factor in the overall confidence index hitting an all-time low in Q3.\\nMore small businesses also anticipate cutting staff over the next year, up from 14% to 18% quarter over quarter.\\nThe percentage of small business owners who describe business conditions as good (33%), went down again, from 36% in Q2 2022. Just over half (51%) of small business owners say the economy is \"poor,\" up from 44% last quarter.\\nAlmost three-quarters (74%) expect higher interest rates to be a negative for their business.\\nThe confidence index score was 42 out of 100, down from 46 in the second quarter. The previous low was a score of 43 during the first quarter of the Biden Administration.\\xa0\\nWade said that even as many small business owners in the NFIB survey don\\'t think the recession has begun, they are anticipating economic headwinds. \"We\\'ve seen a falling off of those expecting higher sales in the next quarter,\" she said.\\nBut currently, she said employment and sales in the small business sector are \"holding up.\"\\nThe small business demographic skews conservative and the confidence index reflects some partisan sentiment and persistent gaps in survey answers based on politics. For example, 69% of Republican small business owners believe the economy is in a recession, compared to 34% of Democrats polled. This gap is even wider in how small business owners describe the economy, with 68% of Republicans using the word \"poor,\" compared with 19% of Democrats.\\nMore troubling for President Joe Biden, though, is the significant percentage of small business owners who identify as Democrats and think inflation will continue to rise. While that figure is 89% among Republicans, and the partisan gap is wide, more than half of Democrats (51%) agree.\\nPresident Biden\\'s approval rating on Main Street hit the lowest level of his administration, with 31% of small business owners approving of how he has handled the job of president.\\nWhile 81% of small business owners who are Democrats approve of Biden, pollsters have noted during this period of high inflation that presidents expect the vast majority of their party to offer support, often north of 90%. And as the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey has shown this year, Biden\\'s approval rating will not improve unless inflation goes down. Biden\\'s approval among important swing voters who identify as independents is at 29%.\\nOnly 9% of Republicans approve of Biden\\'s handling of the presidency.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'The popularity of golf has\\xa0surged in recent years and during the pandemic, with new golfers and the further spread of non-traditional ways to play like TopGolf helping to start to shed the sport\\'s stodgy reputation.\\nGrammy award-winning rapper Macklemore, best known for his hit song \"Thrift Shop,\" recently fell in love with golf, but found that the clothes marketed to players didn\\'t appeal to him.\\n\"On vacation, I got dragged out onto the golf course and didn\\'t want to go – I definitely hit a couple of houses,\" Macklemore told CNBC\\'s Dominic Chu at the CNBC Small Business Playbook virtual summit on Wednesday. \"Finally, I pure a five iron out of a fairway bunker, and I was enthralled. Like, what was that feeling? I need that again.\"\\nMacklemore, whose real name is Ben Haggerty, said that shortly thereafter he went to a sporting goods store, but realized that \"the pickings in terms of golf fashion were very slim, and that\\'s being generous.\"\\n\"Golf clothes have one archetype of a male, white dude in mind,\" he said. \"Golf is much bigger than that.\"\\nGolf struggled to shed that perception, even during Tiger Woods\\' ascendance to becoming one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.\\nBut there is hope that an influx of new players will help shift that archetype. An estimated 3.2 million people played on a golf course for the first time in 2021, up 33% from 2019 and well exceeding the number of people who flocked to the game following Woods\\' early successes in 1999 and 2000, according to The National Golf Foundation. More rounds were played last year than ever before in history, according to NGF.\\nWhile some of that momentum has slowed — rounds played in 2022 are down roughly 6% compared to last year — that influx of new, younger players has helped to energize the game, Macklemore said.\\n\"There\\'s a whole generation of young people that got into golf in the last one to three years that don\\'t want to look like they sell real estate, and I think that\\'s great,\" he said.\\nA fan of 1970s- and 1980s-era golf fashion even before becoming a golfer, the desire to fill the clothing need for golfers such as himself led Macklemore to start the Bogey Boys apparel brand.\\nThe brand, which features items like Cheetah print knit vests, pinstriped sweaters, and colorful polos, is designed to appeal to both golfers and high-fashion lovers alike, Macklemore said, something that many of the typical brands in the golf-wear space do not consider.\\n\"I think for so many other brands, it\\'s contingent upon people playing golf, or else you\\'re not going to wear these clothes,\" he said. \"Something I think that has happened with the pandemic and golf skyrocketing is that you\\'re seeing a shred of golf fashion in the streetwear space – you can go to [fashion website] Hypebeast and see articles on golf, that\\'s something very new.\"\\nMacklemore is not the first golf-enthusiast entertainer to try to shake up the sport\\'s look. In 2011, Justin Timberlake was named the creative director of Callaway Golf, working on the club and apparel maker\\'s \"visual representation.\" Bill Murray, famous for his role in \"Caddyshack,\" started William Murray Golf in 2016. NBA star Steph Curry started creating golf apparel with Under Armour in 2019, leading to the launch of his golf line under his Curry Brand offshoot.\\nThat uptick in new players as well as new products has been a boon for golf apparel, typically led by companies like Adidas, Nike, Callaway, and Acushnet-owned Footjoy. More than $150 million of golf apparel was sold in April, with 21 of the last 22 months seeing sales increases month-over-month, according to golf product industry tracker Golf Datatech.\\nBut even if the growth of golf tapers off, Macklemore said the focus on fashion unlike other golf-focused apparel will still benefit Bogey Boys.\\n\"Any sport waxes and wanes, that\\'s ok,\" he said. \"The clothes are still going to be top-notch, the quality is going to be great, and people are going to feel great and look great in the garments.\"\\n',\n",

I was in my late thirties, and I didn\\'t know the word \\'brand,\\' I didn\\'t know the word \\'entrepreneur,\\'\" Bethenny Frankel, founder of SkinnyGirl, told Sharon Epperson at the CNBC Small Business Playbook virtual summit on Wednesday.\\nNow, just over a decade later, Frankel is a widely successful and self-made entrepreneur, who sold her pre-packaged low-calorie margarita, Skinnygirl Cocktails, for a reported $120 million, and continues to delve into a series of ambitious business ventures with her Skinnygirl lifestyle brand, ranging from specialty food items to branded apparel.\\xa0\\nWhile she may not have always envisioned a life in business, she always envisioned her next big idea, and what it would take to turn it into reality, she told Epperson.\\n\"I just always was an ideas person. I could not help but to execute on crazy ideas that I had,\" Frankel said.\\xa0\\nThe Skinnygirl brand was one of those ideas — the simple vision of having her own signature cocktail. \"I think very simply, I wanted to have a cocktail for myself, that I wanted to drink, and that could be a signature cocktail that I always went for,\" she explained.\\nThat personal need was not an idea she immediately knew would catch on with millions of others.\\n\"I had no idea that I was creating the first-ever low-calorie margarita or creating a category in ready-to-drink cocktails,\" she said. But once she realized how popular the concept was, she knew that she had the opportunity to turn it into a successful business.\\xa0\\nThat transition to business building is where Frankel stresses that having a good entrepreneurial idea isn\\'t what made her story exceptional. \"When you\\'re young, and you think you\\'re smart, everybody thinks they\\'re smart. You think you have a good idea — everyone has a good idea,\" she said.\\nA good idea may have been the start in setting her apart, but drive and motivation are more important in business.\\xa0\\n\"I\\'ve really realized it\\'s those people that have that drive and that determination and that passion, that unstoppable nature — that\\'s really the true ingredient for success,\" Frankel said. \"Because so many people have good ideas. And the world and technology and what\\'s popular is changing all of the time, so if you have that constant — of being a hard, old-school worker, you\\'ll be successful. People around you will see how valuable that is, because it\\'s very, very rare,\" she added.\\nFrankel says in addition to a strong work ethic, personal investment and authenticity are essential pieces in a successful entrepreneurial venture.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\"Business is lonely, you are alone,\" she said. \"You sign that dotted line alone, it\\'s your reputation, it\\'s all about you alone. … No one cares as much as you about your business,\" she told Epperson.\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe also rejects the idea that business and personal life should — or can — be kept separate.\\nThe line between business life and personal life has become increasingly blurred, especially since the onset of the pandemic, as many workers began to work from home, and the decisions made in one sphere have held new significance in the other.\\xa0\\nAnd in a time characterized by inflation and rising interest rates, and in which business owners are increasingly concerned with supply chain issues and labor shortages, business choices have proven to be unavoidably personal choices, too.\\xa0\\n\"Business is very, very personal. How I spend my money in my personal life could affect the money that I would or wouldn\\'t have to invest in business ideas. How I operate in my business life could affect the types of schools my daughter would have gone to, or how I treat my business affects how I spend my time — which is so personal,\" Frankel said.\\nNew business formation numbers have been high since the pandemic began, and Frankel said uncertain times also provide opportunity.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\"I think that people keep looking at the equation one way and keep trying the same key in the door, but now is the time when you have to fumble around and try a bunch of different keys and figure out what fits for you. Because when you have times of disarray, when you have times of crazy chaos, there is also a silver lining. There are other opportunities,\" she said.\\xa0\\nFrankel, who has bought and sold real estate over the years, pivoted to suburban real estate at the beginning of the pandemic, which proved to be a savvy business move.\\xa0\\nStill, even amid business evolution, staying grounded in your core mission is essential, according to Frankel. \"You have to be able to pivot and shift, but also stay true to the base and core of what your business is,\" she said.\\xa0\\nFor any entrepreneur who is facing stagnation, Frankel advises focusing on their own needs and interests, rather than worrying about what others are doing. \"Think about what you react to. What are you consuming, what are you digesting, what are you interested in, what are you attracted to, what do you like, what do you not like? And put that forward in your work,\" she said.\\xa0\\nFrankel\\'s personal wish for a low-calorie, ready-to-drink cocktail turned into a multimillion-dollar enterprise.\\xa0\\nIt is this turning within, before expanding out into the market, that makes business, at its core, quintessentially personal.\\n\"It has to come from within. What really speaks to you, it\\'s likely something that speaks to many people\" she said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'The retail battle narrative over the past few decades has cited one of two wars: Amazon and e-commerce against the big bricks-and-mortar retailers, and everybody big against small Main Street entrepreneurs. But in the current confusing economic environment — marked by inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and a volatile consumer changing spending patterns due to the high prices which followed Covid — small business experts say that Main Street should be more optimistic about the advantages of being small.\\nThe inventory builds and subsequent markdowns from the biggest retailers, including Walmart and Target, show that even the best can get this consumer economy wrong. In fact, small business owners, being closer to relationships on both the supply and customer ends, may be able to more nimbly manage a fast-changing environment.\\nThat\\'s the advice from Nada Sanders, Northeastern University distinguished professor of supply chain management. She told CNBC\\'s Small Business Playbook virtual summit on Wednesday that she has been \"gloom and doom\" in the past, but is now optimistic about Main Street\\'s chances in the current economy.\\n\"I actually see this as a tremendous opportunity. I really do. Especially for small businesses,\" Sanders said.\\nShe cites three areas where entrepreneurs should be focused, and the first is directly related to the big box retailer woes: forecasting. \\n\"The big companies are really struggling with that,\" Sanders, who is an academic expert on forecasting, said. \"We see it, obviously, with the retailers. Walmart, Target.\" \\nHer opinion is that the biggest companies have become too reliant on inventory algorithms to forecast data, but in the current economy, which has defied many historical patterns, \"historical data in this space right now isn\\'t really good data. It\\'s not clean data, it doesn\\'t indicate the future that is very volatile,\" she said. \\nThis gives small business owners who can connect directly with customers, to understand what their needs are, a potential advantage that can\\'t be calculated by an algorithm. \\nWhether a small business is B2B or B2C, Sanders said direct communication is a \"real answer\" for them right now in dealing with changing consumer behavior. \\n\"What I\\'m seeing with the big companies, they\\'re trying to hire futurists and trying to figure out ways to actually predict demand. But every time we look at the numbers, the Consumer Price Index, all of it, we\\'re looking backwards,\" Sanders said. \"The fact of the matter is, we\\'re in a very quickly changing landscape and I think we have to look forward. Small business owners really need to connect and use judgment to forecast and to understand what their customers need.\"\\n\"As a small business owner on a tight budget ... you don\\'t even need the really heavy duty AI, which I think a lot of small business owners, they get a little bit nervous. ...  You can actually make a lot of gains with really simple solutions,\" Sanders said, \"When you\\'re a small business, you have an end-to-end control that a large business doesn\\'t have. I see this as a really big opportunity,\" she added.\\nIt will be a leap for many entrepreneurs to come around to this view. Data shows that the current sentiment on Main Street is pessimistic. The latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q3 2022 showed that small business confidence hit an all-time low, with the largest percentage of small businesses citing inflation as their biggest risk.\\nIn the Q3 survey, an increasing percentage of small businesses forecast a sales decline over the next 12 months as the economy, in their view, is already in a recession. The downbeat sales outlook was the biggest contributor to the all-time low in confidence being hit. And as small businesses face higher costs in inputs, labor, transportation and energy, few (only 13%) say now is a good time to pass along price increases to customers, according to the survey.\\nBut pricing is also an area where small businesses can effectively, and directly, communicate with their customers and find solutions.\\nJeffrey Robinson, Rutgers Business School provost and executive vice-chancellor, and co-founder of the Center for Urban Entrepreneurship and Economic Development, said at the Small Business Playbook virtual summit that one big mistake business owners make is to not figure out pricing on new products until it is too late. At a time of high inflation, entrepreneurs need to be basing any pricing of new items on a detailed analysis of the costs that go into producing it. A traditional way that businesses set pricing — decide on the product and then once it is available look at what competitors are charging — is not the way to operate in this economy. Inflation requires that small business owners set price by, first and foremost, understanding their costs.\\n\"All those prices along the supply chain have gone up,\" Robinson said. \"The shipping costs ... anything that has any component of transportation involved, those costs have gone up. So assessing and valuing your product or service that you\\'re providing along those costs, before you set the price, allows you to set the price at the right level,\" he said.\\nAnd then comes the hard part: explaining it to the customer. Robinson says the direct relationship that small businesses have with their customers should be seen as an advantage, too.\\n\"We have relationships. Talk,\" he said. \"Explore. You\\'ve got to explain to them that the costs have gone up for these components. \\'In order for me to do this, I have to change some pricing,\\'\" he said.\\nHelping customers understand the situation that a business is in related to supply chain inflation is going to help set prices in an appropriate way, he said. In the end, Robinson said it is really no different than a restaurant that has always shown the price of a fish on the menu to be \"market price.\" That may be a simplified example, but it has reverberated in the current situation.\\nSome restaurants have put signs out front during the current inflationary period to be transparent with customers about pricing changes. Robinson didn\\'t weigh in on that method specifically, but did say every business needs to have some form of conversation with customers and potential customers about the fact that the prices of two years ago are not going to be the prices of today. While the survey data shows that small business owners are wary of this conversation, Robinson said they shouldn\\'t be.\\n\"I believe a lot of consumers understand that, especially if you\\'re a business-to-consumer type of business,\" he said. \"It\\'s about being transparent ... helping people understand that pricing is changing.\"\\nThe conversation with suppliers is no less important, and Sanders said the data shows that, on average, 80% of a company\\'s spend goes towards about 6% of their suppliers. Those are the business partners to focus on, and where to pick up the phone and call and build a relationship. \"As a small company, this is really what it\\'s going to be about,\" Sanders said. \"What I think you need to do as a small company is really be able to map your supply chain for your key items, talk to your vendors, really build partnerships,\" she said.\\nMost big companies don\\'t have great visibility below their tier one suppliers, according to Sanders, so many items become harder to track that are far back in the supply chain, \"tier four, tier five,\" she said.\\nA small business can map out its supply chain and work with partners to visualize the entire chain and identify the risks. Right now, the inventory issues in retail might make small business owners more reluctant to stock up — even though it is the start of peak shopping season, with back-to-school and then the holidays. Sanders said she is firm believer in running a \"lean\" operation, but in the current economy, \"we need to implement some caveats to the meaning of lean.\"\\nIn certain cases, small businesses are going to have to store extra items, critical items with longer lead times, and where there are expected price increases. All businesses should also be taking a look at their production processes and whether alternatives exist that could lead to more cost-effective operations. Carrying extra inventories \"flies in the face of lean,\" she said, but she added, \"the advantage for a small business is really being able to manage at the same time, upstream and downstream, and coordinate those.\"\\nThe biggest problem in the current economy is the mismatch between demand supply, and that\\'s where Sanders comes back to the issues Walmart and Target have faced and why small businesses should take an opportunistic view of the situation, and be proactive about conversations on both the supply side and end customer side of their operations. \\n\"Large companies are dinosaurs. ... They\\'re very heavy, bureaucratic. As a small business, you\\'re very limber,\" she said.\\nThe key for small business owners is to not only look one way, either downstream (customer) or upstream (supplier). \"But look at those at the same time, really marry those, watch them, and connect with customers, connect with all the vendors,\" Sanders said. \"Large companies can\\'t do that. They\\'re stuck because they have huge silos. As a small business, you don\\'t have that, so leverage that right now.\"\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nWhatsApp is already widely popular with U.S. consumers. Now Meta Platforms is turning more attention to building its small business base.\\nThe Facebook parent company launched WhatsApp Business in 2018 with free, simple tools to help small businesses keep in touch with customers, offering a way for them to directly interact, search for products and indicate purchasing interest.\\xa0\\nSoon the company will roll out a premium service to small businesses, and it\\'s doubling down on a newer advertising format called \"click-to-message,\" which allows consumers to click on a company\\'s ad within Facebook or Instagram and directly start a conversation with that business on Messenger, Instagram or WhatsApp.\\nThese initiatives offer Meta the ability to boost advertising revenue, stay relevant with small businesses and gain incremental revenue from the premium services offered, analysts said.\\nMeta (then Facebook) bought WhatsApp in October 2014 for around $22 billion. Since then, industry watchers have been watching closely for signs the company plans to monetize the platform more. That time could now be coming.\\n\"If I stay on any of the Meta properties and I\\'m communicating using Meta, asking questions, and buying — all within the platform — there is no signal loss, and it\\'s easier for Meta to tell the brand its return-on-advertising spend,\" said Mark Kelley, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Stifel. \"Signal loss is really what\\'s been impacting social media companies this year.\"\\nWhatsApp will be the \"next chapter\" in the company\\'s history, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently told CNBC\\'s Jim Cramer. He noted that the company\\'s \"playbook over time\" has been to build services to serve a wide audience and \"scale the monetization\" after reaching that goal. \"And we\\'ve done that with Facebook and Instagram. WhatsApp is really going to be the next chapter, with business\\xa0messaging and commerce being a big thing there,\" he said.\\nThis messaging from Meta comes at a time of transition for the company and uncertainty among investors. The company recently reported an earnings and revenue miss and forecast a second straight quarter of declining sales. Meta Platforms shares have lost roughly half their value this year. Mark Zuckerberg is betting large sums of money, currently at a loss, on a future in which the metaverse will be a growth driver for the company. But with his bet on the metaverse as far as a decade out before coming to fruition, the Meta CEO has stressed that in the short-term it is WhatsApp that is among the initiatives to focus on for growth.\\nWhatsApp Business has two components. There\\'s the WhatsApp Business app for small businesses. There\\'s also the WhatsApp Business platform, an API, for larger businesses like banks, airlines or e-commerce companies. The first 1,000 conversations on the platform each month are free. After that, businesses are charged per conversation, which includes all messages delivered in a 24-hour session, based on regional rates.\\nWith the free app, small businesses can communicate directly with customers. They can set up automated messages to respond to customers, after business hours, for instance, with information about the business, such as a menu or their company\\'s location. Businesses can use it to send product pictures and descriptions to customers as well as other information they might be interested in. At present, there\\'s no ability to pay through WhatsApp, but it\\'s a feature Meta is considering, a company spokesman said.\\nPremium features for small businesses — to be rolled out in the coming months — will include the ability to manage chats across up to 10 devices as well as new customizable WhatsApp click-to-chat links to help businesses attract customers across their online presence, the company said in its blog.\\xa0\\n\"We think messaging in general is the future of how people are going to want to communicate with businesses and vice versa. It\\'s the fastest and easiest way to get things done,\" the spokesman said.\\nAnalysts see the broad potential. \"Messaging is an international forum that everybody uses on an ongoing basis. It\\'s massive and it\\'s growing,\" said Brian Fitzgerald, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.\\nThere\\'s considerable room for growth in the U.S., where WhatsApp is still a \"a largely untapped resource by small businesses,\" said Rob Retzlaff, executive director of The Connected Commerce Council, a non-profit organization that promotes small businesses\\' access to digital technologies and tools.\\nThat\\'s something Meta sees changing over time. \"We are deep believers that that behavior will continue to grow all over the world,\" said Sheryl Sandberg, the company\\'s chief operating officer, on its second-quarter earnings call on July 27. The company estimates that 1 billion users are messaging with a business each week across WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram.\\xa0\\nThe need for free and low-cost digital tools for small businesses is underscored by a 2021 report from The Connected Commerce Council. The report noted that about 11 million small businesses would have closed all or part of their business if not for digital tools that allowed them to continue to operate.\\xa0\\nOne driver for Meta in promoting WhatsApp Business is advertising revenue. \"Click- to-message is already a multi-billion dollar business for us and we continue to see strong double-digit year-over-year growth,\" Sandberg said on the second quarter earnings call. Click-to-message \"is one of our fastest growing ad formats for us,\" she added. The company does not break out how much of the business comes from WhatsApp versus Messenger or Instagram.\\nBusinesses like this format because it\\'s \"an inexpensive way to interact [with consumers] that feels a little more personal,\" said Stifel\\'s Kelley. What\\'s more, it also alleviates a problem caused by the privacy change Apple made to its iOS operating system last year.\\xa0\\nSay, for instance, a customer views a Facebook ad for a sneaker retailer and connects directly with the business through WhatsApp. \"In a world where we\\'re trying to do more and more with less and less data, there\\'s no leakage here. Everything\\'s protected,\" Fitzgerald said. \"Nobody [else] in the world knows I bought these sneakers and there\\'s a direct business-to-consumer connection.\"\\xa0\\nMoreover, by offering premium services, Meta could boost revenue, at least incrementally, Kelley said.\\nJosé Montoya Gamboa, owner of Malhaya in Mexico, who has been using the free business app for several years, said he plans to pay for the premium version when it becomes available because he likes the ability to use it on multiple devices.\\nBut Geraldine Colocia, community manager at Someone Somewhere, a certified B Corporation that collaborates with hundreds of artisans around Mexico, isn\\'t sure. She\\'s been using the free version of the app for more than two years, and would consider paying for it, but the decision will turn on the actual features and the pricing, she said.\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'After a year-long dip, household cash flow will begin growing again right after Christmas, and accelerate through the new year, according to new research by analysts at Goldman Sachs.\\nThese gains will reverse a year of negative growth of about $600, or 4.2%, in household discretionary cash flow, according to Goldman\\'s analysis.\\n\"This year, we\\'re looking at negative discretionary cash flow for the first time since the 2008-09 financial crisis,\" Goldman consumer goods analyst Jason English said on a recent webinar with the press. The biggest driver of the cash flow improvement next year, he said, will be wages.\\nThat\\'s good news for retail sales after a yearlong struggle to keep up with inflation, and for the economy\\'s ability to avoid a recession, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\\'s Analytics, which has a similar forecast of improving consumer finances.\\n\"Cash flow got hit during 2022 but it\\'s coming back, and cash flow is what drives spending,\" Zandi said. \"Businesses are unlikely to cut jobs because they know their biggest problem is finding workers,\" Zandi added. \\xa0\\nWhile much has been made of the consumer resilience during a period of slowing economic growth, the market has punished retail companies, which have declined roughly twice as much as the broader U.S. stock market index this year, measured by the relative performance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF and S&P 500 Index. This year\\'s sloppy performance in consumer spending is happening because households have less cash coming in — even though they have more savings — since stimulus payments designed to fight the Covid pandemic ended in 2021.\\nRetail sales in the U.S. have risen about 10% in the last year, but most of that reflects the surging dollar value of gasoline and other goods sold at this year\\'s inflated prices, according to recent Commerce Department data. Auto sales have risen just 1.5 percent, far below the pace of inflation. That has helped the pace of inflation-adjusted consumer spending growth slow to about 1.5 percent in the first half of 2022, compared with nearly 12 percent a year earlier.\\nThe surge in capital goods spending during the brief Covid recession, as consumers snapped up furniture and other home-related goods when they spent more time at home due to the pandemic, contributed to retail\\'s slump this year because it pulled demand forward, English said.\\nBut the turn is coming, according to Goldman.\\nThe drop in consumer cash flow began as a steep one, but the spread between 2021 and 2022 has been steadily narrowing. In the first quarter, consumers had 10% less discretionary cash available than in the same month a year earlier, which Goldman says will narrow to a 2.7 percent dip this quarter and a 1.2 percent drop for the holiday season.\\nThe cash flow measure Goldman uses adds other sources of cash, like government transfer payments and borrowing, to current income, and subtracts essential expenses like food and fuel, giving a fuller picture of consumers\\' likely ability and willingness to spend.\\xa0\\nNext year, the numbers get more positive through the year, Goldman\\'s estimates show. Consumer cash flow will rise by 2 percent in the first quarter, and rise to 6 percent-plus in the second half of 2023, an overall gain of about $600 billion.\\nWhile the upswing in consumer income is good news for the economy, it may not benefit all firms equally, according to CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram, who expects the gain in consumer income will help big retailers the most. Large-scale players like Amazon and Walmart, and to a lesser degree Target, will be winners and take market share, he said.\\nThe sluggish retail conditions of this year may keep smaller consumer companies from gaining access to capital markets that have gotten more selective even as conditions improve. \"They should have raised money a year ago,\" Sundaram said. \"Now markets are tighter ... They\\'re trying to cut expenses and reduce their cash burn.\"\\xa0\\nWhile Sundaram was focusing on consumer startups that went public in recent years, such as Oatly and Beyond Meat, the mood among America\\'s broader small business community is not optimistic, with inflation continuing to hurt Main Street\\'s ability to maintain margins at a time of higher prices in inputs, from raw materials to energy, transportation and labor. Most small business owners believe a recession is inevitable; in fact, some think the recession has already begun and have reduced their sales outlook into the next year, according to the latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q3 2022, which saw small business confidence hit an all-time low.\\nMeanwhile, the world\\'s largest retailer Walmart — which had lowered second-quarter profit targets but then reported a beat on August 16, devoted much of its second-quarter earnings call to explaining its investment plans — which chief financial officer John David Rainey said will be one source of the chain\\'s hopes to boost profitability in the year ahead.\\xa0\\nWalmart has boosted capital spending 50% to $7.5 billion in the first half of its fiscal year, which ends in January. Rival Target, which experienced a 90 percent drop in second quarter earnings, nearly doubled investment, to $2.52 billion from $1.34 billion. Walmart CFO John Rainey cited the buildout of automation and technology throughout its business, and how it will continue to help drive greater efficiency, in a call with analysts after its earnings. He pointed to the company\\'s augmented-reality Viz Pick technology, which uses workers\\' cell phones to speed up restocking of shelves to avoid lost sales.\\nBefore the coming pop in customer income, retailers still have to get through the back to school and holiday shopping seasons, when household income will still be a little lower than it was in 2021 and retailers will still be dealing with excess inventory of home-related goods that they have been marking down and writing off.\\n\"If we\\'re cleared by the holidays, we\\'re in much better shape going forward than the market is currently estimating,\" English said.\\xa0\\n\\n',\n",

More than 15,000 accounts were used in the conspiracy, by individuals in the U.S. as well as domestic and transnational organized crime rings, the agency said.\\nInvestigations are ongoing and further information about suspects was not immediately released. The investigation was initiated by the Secret Service field office in Orlando, Florida, and Green Dot bank worked with the agency to identify the fraudulent accounts.\\n\"Fraudsters in general are always looking for ways and techniques to better do their crimes and modern conveniences are just one of those things they use. So currently, cryptocurrency is a big thing, fintechs, third-party payment systems. But there\\'s not an institution, even our traditional financial institutions, that weren\\'t targeted during the pandemic,\" Roy Dotson, lead investigator for the Secret Service, told CNBC in an interview.\\nInitial investigations indicated the majority of the fraudulent accounts at Green Dot were established with synthetic and stolen identities, and involved using \"willing and unwilling money mules,\" Dotson said.\\nThe Secret Service and SBA Office of Inspector General put out advisories to 30,000 financial institutions in early 2020 to lay out fraud indicators and guide the banks to partner with federal agencies to recover fraudulent funds, Dotson said. He added these investigations will likely last years due to their size and scope.\\nGreen Dot said it has partnered with federal agencies including the Secret Service to identify fraud in the industry.\\n\"Account protection and fraud prevention are top priorities for us, and we work around the clock and invest heavily to identify, block and address fraudulent activity. We\\'re committed to protecting customers, and also to serving as [a] proactive ally to government agencies and industry peers as we work together to prevent fraud,\" Green Dot spokeswoman Alison Lubert said in a statement.\\nOIG Inspector General Hannibal Ware said the partnership with the Secret Service has to date resulted in more than 400 indictments and nearly 300 convictions related to pandemic fraud.\\nThe U.S. government allocated more than $1 trillion to Main Street under both the Paycheck Protection Program and EIDL program. The PPP allowed small businesses to borrow loans that may be forgiven if the borrower used the majority of the capital on payroll, while the Covid-19 EIDL program allowed borrowers to access loans based on temporary losses of revenue due to the pandemic. An advance grant was also available under the EIDL.\\nReviews of the two programs by the SBA\\'s Office of Inspector General warned that criminals would potentially exploit the system due to the fast-moving nature of the rollout and demand for aid. CNBC investigations revealed, in some cases, how easy it was for criminals to obtain fraudulent aid via stolen identities.\\nThe SBA OIG said it has identified $87 billion of potentially fraudulent EIDL loans.\\nOver the past two years, the Secret Service said it has seized over $1.4 billion in fraudulently obtained funds and assisted in returning some $2.3 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Nearly 4,000 pandemic-related fraud investigations and inquiries have been initiated by the Secret Service. More than 150 field offices and 40 cyber task forces are involved.\\n\"This is not going to be a quick fix. As we talked about today, 15,325 accounts at one financial institution — this is one case, so you can just think of the potential number of suspects and how many investigations that could come out of those. And with all of our federal, state and local partners working this and having the same mission. It\\'s going to be a long process,\" Dotson said at a news conference announcing the returned funds.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'The Federal Reserve\\'s decision to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, or 75 basis points, for the third-consecutive time at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, is a step being taken to cool the economy and bring down inflation, but it is also putting small business owners across the country in a lending fix they have not experienced since the 1990s.\\nIf the Federal Reserve\\'s FOMC next moves match the market\\'s expectation for two more interest rate hikes by the end of the year, small business loans will reach at least 9%, maybe higher, and that will bring business owners to a difficult set of decisions. Businesses are healthy today, especially those in the rebounding services sector, and credit performance remains good throughout the small business community, according to lenders, but the Fed\\'s more aggressive turn against inflation will lead more business owners to think twice about taking out new debt for expansion.\\nPartly, it is psychological: with many business owners never having operated in anything but a low interest rate environment, the sticker shock on debt stands out more even if their business cash flow remains healthy enough to cover the monthly repayment. But there will also be more businesses finding it harder to make cash flow match monthly repayment at a time of high inflation across all of their other business costs, including goods, labor, and transportation.\\n\"Demand for lending hasn\\'t changed yet, but we\\'re getting dangerously close to where people will start to second guess,\" said Chris Hurn, the founder and CEO of Fountainhead, which specializes in small business lending.\\n\"We\\'re not there yet,\" he said. \"But we\\'re closer.\"\\nAs traditional banks and credit unions tighten lending standards and businesses begin to breach debt covenants based on debt service coverage ratios — the amount of cash flow needed to cover debt — more business owners will turn to the SBA loan market in which firms like Hurn\\'s specialize.\\n\"Every time we get into one of these cycles and the economy is slowing and rates are going up, one of the few places to get business credit is SBA lenders,\" he said.\\nBut even in the SBA market, business owners are beginning to pause as a result of the Fed\\'s rate actions, said Rohit Arora, co-founder and CEO of Biz2Credit, which also focuses on small business lending. \"From a credit perspective, people are getting more cognizant about increasing interest cost, and that the Fed will keep interest rates at 4-4.50%,\" Arora said.\\nFed officials signaled the intention on Wednesday of continuing to hike until the funds level hits a \"terminal rate,\" or end point of 4.6% in 2023.\\n\"Even a month ago, this was a \\'2022 phenomenon\\' and now they will have to live with the pain for longer,\" Arora said. \"It\\'s a harder decision now because you don\\'t have the Fed \\'put\\' behind you,\" he added, referring to an environment in which you could bank on adjustable loan rates not going higher.\\nThe big change since the summer, reflected in the stock market as well, is the acknowledgment that the Fed is not likely to quickly reverse its interest rate hikes, as inflation proves stickier than previously forecast, and key areas of the economy, like the labor market, don\\'t cool fast enough. As recently as the last FOMC meeting in July, many economists, traders and business owners expected the Fed to be cutting rates as soon as early 2023.\\nNow, according to CNBC\\'s surveying of economists and investment managers, the Fed is likely to reach peak rates above 4% and hold rates there throughout 2023. This outlook implies at least two more rate hikes in November and December, for a total of at least 75 basis points more, and including Wednesday\\'s hike, 150 basis points in all from September through the end of the year. And that is a big change for business owners.\\nThe FOMC meeting decision reinforced this expectation of a more hawkish Fed, with the two-year treasury bond yield hitting its highest rate since 2007 and the central bank\\'s expectations for when it starts cutting rates again pushed out even further in time. In 2025, the fed funds rate median target is 2.9%, implying restrictive Fed policy into 2025.\\nSBA loans are floating rate loans, meaning they re-adjust based on changes in the prime rate, and that has not been an issue for business owners during the low interest rate environment, but it is suddenly becoming a prominent concern. With SBA loans based on the prime rate, currently at 5.50%, the interest rates are already between 7%-8%. With the prime rate poised to reach 6.25% after the Fed\\'s latest 75 basis point hike, SBA loans are heading to as high as the 9%-9.5% range.\\n\"Most of the business owners today, because they have lived in such a low rate environment, while they have floating interest rate loans they didn\\'t even realize that on existing loans it could go up,\" Arora said. \"Everyone expected with gas prices coming down to what I would call \\'pre-high inflation levels\\' that things looked a lot better. Now people are realizing that oil prices don\\'t solve the problem and that\\'s new for lots of business owners who thought inflation would taper off and the Fed not be so hawkish.\"\\nHe stressed, like Hurn, that demand for business loans is still healthy, and unlike deteriorating consumer credit, small business credit performance is still strong because many firms were underleveraged pre-Covid and then supported by the multiple government programs during the pandemic, including the PPP and SBA EIDL loans. \"They are well capitalized and are seeing strong growth because the economy is still doing pretty well,\" Arora said, and he added that the majority of small businesses are in the service economy, which is the strongest part of the economy right now.\\nBut many business owners were waiting for the Fed to cut in early 2023 before making new loan decisions. Now, they\\'ve been caught flatfooted by adjustable loan rates that went up, and an interest rate environment poised to go higher still.\\n\"Lots of business owners look at gas prices first and that was true for most of the year, and now it\\'s broken down. Wage inflation and rent inflation are running amok, so we\\'re not seeing inflation coming down anytime soon,\" Arora said.\\nThat\\'s leading to more interest in fixed-rate products.\\nDemand for fixed-rate loans is going up because businesses can lock in rates, from a year to three years. \"Though it\\'s pretty late to the game, they feel like maybe the next 14 to 15 months, before rates start coming down, they can at least lock in a rate,\" Arora said. \"The expectation is, in the short term, SBA loans will adjust up and non-SBA loans are shorter tenure,\" he said.\\nSBA loans range from three years to as long as 10 years.\\nA fixed rate loan, even if it is a little higher than an SBA loan today, may be the better option given the change in interest rate outlook. But there\\'s considerable potential downside. Trying to time the Fed\\'s policy has proven difficult. The change from the summer to now is proof of that. So if there is a significant recession and the Fed starts cutting rates earlier than the current expectation, then the fixed-rate loan becomes more expensive and getting out of it, though an option, would entail prepayment penalties.\\n\"That\\'s the one big risk you run if taking a fixed-rate loan in this environment,\" Arora said.\\nThe other tradeoff in choosing a fixed-rate loan: the shorter duration means a higher monthly repayment amount. The amount a business can afford to pay back every month depends on the amount of income coming in, and a fixed rate loan with a higher monthly repayment amount requires a business to have more income to devote to servicing the loan.\\n\"After 2008, business owners never experienced a jumped in SBA loans and now they see monthly interest payments increasing, and are feeling the pinch and starting to plan for it ... get adjusted to the new reality,\" Arora said. \"Demand is still healthy but they are worried about the increased interest cost while they are still battling inflation, even as lower oil prices have helped them.\"\\nAnother cost that is suddenly influencing the SBA loan decision is the end of a waiver this month on SBA loan guaranty fees that are traditionally charged to borrowers so that in the event of a default, the SBA pays the portion of the loan that was guaranteed.\\nWith that waiver ending in September, the cost of guaranteeing a loan can be significant. For example, a 3% SBA guaranty fee on a $500,000 loan would cost the business borrowing the money $15,000.\\n\"It\\'s adding to the costs,\" Arora said.\\nWhile oil prices are coming down, food and other inventory costs remain high, as do rent and labor costs, and that means the need for working capital isn\\'t changing. And business owners who have been through downturns before know that the time to access credit is before the economy and cash flow start to deteriorate. At some point, in the most severe downturns, \"you won\\'t get money at any cost,\" Arora said.\\n\"If you have a reasonably calculated growth plan, no one is going to say keep your head in the sand and wait until Q2 of next year and see where rates are,\" Hurn said. \"Banks don\\'t like to lend when the economy is slowing and there are higher rates, which translate to higher risk of defaults.\"\\nHurn said loan covenants are being \"tripped\" more frequently now in deteriorating sectors of the economy, though that by no means typifies the credit profile on Main Street.\\n\"Once interest rates go up, and if inflation does not go down, we will see more debt service coverage ratios getting violated,\" Arora said. This has to be taken into account because here is a lag between Fed policy decisions and economic impact, and this implies that sticker forms of inflation will last for longer even as sectors like housing and construction are deteriorating.\\nMuch of the surplus liquidity businesses are sitting on due to government support is being eroded, even amid healthy customer demand, because of high inflation. And even if this economic downturn may not be anything like the severe liquidity crisis of 2008, business owners are in a better position when they have the access to credit before the economic situation spirals.\\nThe systemic issues in the financial sector, and the liquidity crisis, were much bigger in 2008. Today, unemployment is much lower, lender balance sheets are much stronger, and corporate balance sheets are stronger too.\\n\"We\\'re just running into a slowing economy,\" Hurn said.\\nWhen he started in small business lending back in 1998, business loans reached as high as 12% to 12.5%. But telling a business owner that today, like telling a mortgage borrower that rates used to be much higher, doesn\\'t help after an artificially low interest rate era.\\n\"Psychologically, people set their expectations for borrowing costs ... \\'they will be this cheap forever,\\'\" Hurn said. \"It\\'s changing radically now.\"\\n\"If rates go close to 10%, psychologically, businesses will start hesitating to borrow,\" Arora said. \\xa0\\nAnd with a peak Fed rate level of 4% or higher reached by late this year, that is where SBA loan rates are heading.\\nAnother 150-175 basis points in total from the Fed, if it has its intended effect of bringing inflation down, would leave many businesses in a stable condition because all of the other costs they are facing outside of debt would be more manageable. But the key question is how quickly the interest rate actions bring down inflation, because the higher rates will impact the cash flow of businesses and their monthly loan payments.\\nLower inflation in stickier parts of the economy, like labor, combined with energy costs remaining lower, would allow small businesses to effectively manage cash flow. But if those things don\\'t happen as quickly as people are expecting, \"then there will be pain, and consumer spending will be down too, and that will have a bigger impact,\" Arora said. \"The challenge is recession and high interest rates together that they have to handle and haven\\'t seen in 40 years,\" he said.\\nRates are not ordinarily considered the determining factor in a business\\'s decision to take out a loan. It should be the business opportunity. But rates can become a determining factor based on the monthly repayment amount, and if a business is looking at cash flow against monthly costs like payroll being harder to make, expansion may have to wait. If rates go up enough, and inflation doesn\\'t fall off fast enough, all borrowing may need to be applied to working capital.\\nOne thing that won\\'t change, though, is that the U.S. economy is based on credit. \"People will continue to borrow, but whether they can borrow at inexpensive rates, or even get capital trying to borrow form traditional sources, remains to be seen,\" Hurn said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'The Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said on Friday there will be \"pain\" to come in the economy as a result of the central bank\\'s battle with inflation, and right now, small businesses are experiencing that pain on both sides of the fight.\\nInflation has been the No. 1 concern of small businesses for some time, as high prices in raw materials, labor, energy and transportation cut into margins. Higher rents, and landlords feeling more aggressive the farther away the nation moves from the peak of Covid, have compounded the hit from inflation being felt on Main Street. While there are some signs of inflation easing across the economy, that\\'s because the Fed is intentionally cooling demand, and that has small business owners anticipating a sales decline.\\nWhat does it all add up to? According to a new national survey of small business owners by Alignable, a big jump in August in the percentage of small business owner who couldn\\'t pay full rent in August.\\nNationally, apartment rental prices, which have soared, are among the inflation indicators that may have recently peaked. But the Alignable data shows that the rent inflation crisis for small businesses is actually getting worse. Forty percent of small business said they could not pay their rent in full this month, up 6% month over month and setting a record for 2022.\\n\"I\\'ve been following this closely every month since March 2020, and I was shocked,\" said Chuck Casto, head of research and communications for Alignable.\\nThe percentage of small business owners unable to make rent hasn\\'t been this high since March 2021. \"This is a number we would have expected right in the middle of the pandemic, when a third of places were shut down, everyone was wearing masks or not going out to restaurants,\" Casto said.\\nAlignable\\'s poll was conducted from August 13-August 22 among 7,331 randomly selected small business owners.\\xa0\\nIt is not new that inflation has become a much bigger concern than Covid on Main Street, but until it eases \"and eases significantly,\" Casto said, all the small business costs are adding up to another existential crisis for Main Street, highlighted by the concerns over rent.\\nForty-five percent of small business owners surveyed by Alignable say they\\'re paying at least 50% more in rent than they did prior to Covid. Twenty-four percent say their landlords have doubled rent; 12% say they are now paying three times more.\\nThe Alignable data also shows that many small business are still struggling to get back to pre-Covid revenue levels, just as the Fed is taking steps that are slowing overall demand. Casto said Alignable would hope that the numbers would be trending down among small business owners who say they have not returned to pre-Covid sales marks, but that\\'s not happening now. Last December, amid the critical holiday season for many small businesses, 43% said they were \"fully back,\" according to Alignable. \"It\\'s 23% now,\" Casto said, \"and has just been slipping. ... even people who thought they were out of the woods in December or January, all of a sudden they\\'re not.\"\\nThat\\'s the worst this indicator has been in over a year, according to Alignable.\\nThe Alignable data matches the recent CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey in mood, which showed small business confidence hitting an all-time low. And Casto says the rent data is critical because it is a tell about the full picture of what is going on with the finances of small businesses.\\nAlignable asks small businesses if inflationary pressures including increased rent could jeopardize their ability to stay open over the next six months, and while that data point has not changed considerably in August, it remains uncomfortably high, at roughly 47%-48%. Of that, 20% are \"highly concerned.\"\\nAs recently as the spring, that figure was as low as 28%.\\nCasto said that\\'s the key figure he will be watching in the months ahead alongside the data on ability to pay rent.\\n\"Many of them still haven\\'t bounced back from Covid, and then you have inflation on top of it, and then, whether you consider this a recession or not, we have an economic slowing and consumer spending down,\" he said.\\nThe CNBC small business survey found that expectations of lower sales were the biggest contributor to the quarterly decline in confidence, and many small business owners believe the recession has already begun.\\n\"We\\'re definitely seeing things recede in terms of activity and customer counts in stores,\" Casto said. The inability to get back to pre-Covid sales in terms of monthly revenue generated doesn\\'t even take into account the extra expenses that inflation has created and a slowing economy. \"It\\'s a combination of everything ... everything builds on itself,\" he added.\\nIt\\'s not all bad news on Main Street. By some recent measures, many small businesses in the service sector, in particular, are doing better and benefitting from the shift in consumer behavior from goods to services purchases. That\\'s what Intuit data shows, and small business is its biggest lines of business. But the Alignable data on rent shows that the impact of inflation remains broad across sectors of the small business economy, even as some sectors are getting hitter harder and faster than others. In real estate, 40% of small businesses said they couldn\\'t make rent in August, up from 18% last December.\\n\"Lots of storefronts, even in fancy towns, are no longer there,\" Casto said. \"We\\'re not quite to ghost town level, but we\\'re worried. ... We\\'re at another level of \\'paying rent or not paying rent\\'. ... It\\'s a much bigger issue.\"\\nThere are options for small businesses that are facing a rent crisis. One is negotiating with landlords, though that is getting tougher to do the farther away we move from peak Covid.\\n\"Landlords feel like they let it slide for a year and a half and did everything they could, but now, two years in the hole, need to start asking for money,\" Casto said. \"Because they could lose their buildings, they are paying mortgages.\"\\nComments Alignable is receiving from small business owners it surveyed show that more are afraid to ask landlords at this point for even more rent relief, and landlord patience after the past two years is running thin. But the survey also indicates that many landlords still prefer to have a tenant making a good faith effort to pay rent, and catch up on any past due rent, than face an empty storefront during the economic slowing.\\n\"Sometimes these landlords are happy to have the place filled even if it is just getting a portion of the rent, it\\'s better than not getting any of it,\" Casto said.\\nFor business to business owners, he recommends at least considering the ability to go fully remote, and take that overhead from real estate and apply it to other areas of the business. This is a move that Alignable says more B2B owners are making, according to the comments it receives in with the survey data.\\nThe situation makes the fourth quarter, always the most critical for B2C small businesses, and for whom rent is now the No. 1 or No. 2 issue, even more important this year. Small businesses always count on holiday sales to be the biggest sales period of the year, and that\\'s no different this year, but it\\'s jut escalated to make-or-break for many businesses.\\nAs the Fed seeks a \"soft landing\" for an economy it says has not entered a recession, there is the chance that if inflation\\'s trajectory continues lower, that will mean lower costs across the board for small businesses, and a potential equilibrium point for Main Street could be reached between a smaller hit on margins and the lower sales that will come with a weaker economy. Small businesses have been adjusting for these past few years, pivoting during the pandemic, taking on side gigs to make their financials work (sometimes more than one), and in some cases, retiring earlier than expected (those numbers are up, too). But if there\\'s a soft landing for Main Street, it\\'s not likely to be apparent until after the end of this year.\\n\"We\\'ve heard from small businesses they are counting on Q4,\" Casto said. \"Q4 will really be telling, and if these numbers don\\'t improve in Q4, I don\\'t even want to say what could happen based on what I am seeing. ... Hopefully, it will be a \\'make it\\' situation for most of them.\"\\n',\n",

She also called on governments to introduce regulations to govern the technology.\\nSingapore\\'s Wong said workers need to learn to adjust and adapt amid the impending disruptions stemming from AI.\\n\"Understandably, this will create anxiety among those who are less able to adjust and adapt. All of us will do more to help workers refresh and update their skills so that they can stay competitive and relevant in an increasingly digital world,\" he said.\\n\"We cannot leave this for markets to take care of themselves. Neither can we say this is just the responsibility of employers alone,\" stressed Wong.\\nHe added that regulators need to implement \"comprehensive support\" in the form of job matching and skills development. \"This will require concerted and proactive efforts on the part of governments, industry and skills training providers,\" said Wong.\\nSingapore launched AI Verify, the world\\'s first testing toolkit, to help companies objectively assess and verify whether their AI products are responsible and meet the international principles, said Wong.\\nThe country will continue to work with the industry on pilot projects and drive the development of AI testing standards, he added.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'While French President Emmanuel Macron was in Germany for dinner and alliance-building talks with Chancellor Olaf Scholz this week, more than 200,000 protesters were on the streets at home to oppose one of his flagship domestic policies.\\nBefore marking six years in office on May 14, Macron managed to pass a bill that will see the retirement age for most workers rise from 62 to 64, among other measures. Reforming the pension system was a longstanding pledge of Macron\\'s, but enacting it nearly toppled his government, sparked weeks of strikes and demonstrations, and caused his already-shaky popularity rating to plummet.\\nOngoing efforts by opposition politicians to thwart the bill faced another blockage this week, and it looks most likely to be secured into law in September, as planned.\\nUnion-led protests will no doubt continue but with the dust almost settled around the issue, the president is looking at what\\'s next for the four years left of his term (he is not allowed to run for another consecutively.)\\nHe has already demonstrated that foreign policy and forging alliances on overseas trips will be a key focus, from China to Ukraine to the U.K.\\nAt home, Macron faces the question of whether he has used up too much political capital to enact what is left of his domestic agenda, and how he will navigate a bitterly-divided Parliament.\\nHe has failed to build effective alliances beyond the conservative Les Republicains — something its lawmakers, not all of whom supported the pensions bill, are very aware of, said senior lecturer in the economics department at Lancaster University, Renaud Foucart.\\n\"They know Macron has no alternative than to rely on them, making it almost impossible to develop the centrist domestic project,\" he said.\\nFoucart said one case of this may be Macron\\'s long-postponed immigration law, which combines a conservative angle — making deportations easier — with a more progressive one that aims to make it easier for undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers to find work. The bill has met with strong opposition on the left and right, and Les Republicains presented its own, more right-leaning proposal last month.\\nMujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at consultancy Eurasia Group, said in a research note that Macron likely believes that to avoid being a \"lame duck\" for the next four years, \"he must prove that he is not doomed to domestic impotence within the next four months.\"\\nHe may hope for a relatively easy win in the form of a planned 30% boost to defense spending and a program to modernize military equipment, Rahman said, since this is largely only controversial on the left of the political spectrum.\\nAnother key focus for Macron and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is a green industry bill that Rahman also believes will likely gather enough support to pass in the coming months.\\nPresented to Parliament on May 16 and set for a first reading on June 19, this is a broad effort toward a decarbonized \"reindustrialization\" of France, with measures including billions in grants for green industrial projects, green energy projects and cuts to red tape for setting up new factories.\\nMacron has concurrently been on a push to attract electric vehicle factories as Europe scrambles to increase capacity, offering tax credits for environmentally-friendly investments, and pushing the EU to get competitive with the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act; as well as courting executives — including Elon Musk — to increase foreign investment in the country.\\nMore controversial, adds Rahman, is the \"dose of protectionism\" in Macron\\'s bill that will see green subsidies, including for consumers who buy electric cars, only applied to goods that meet EU environmental regulations, excluding many China-produced products.\\nWhile he has united factions of French society including unions, the left and the far-right against him, Macron has economic accomplishments to point to, according to Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg.\\n\"France is now a much better place to invest and create jobs. It is now well ahead of Germany for job creation, start-ups and business investment. This is largely attributable to Macron\\'s agenda,\" Schmieding said, adding France was replacing Germany was the most dynamic major European economy.\\nMacron will continue to roll out the red carpet to investors, Schmieding said, as well as generating a significant rise in green investment over time.\\nStill, the coming years will be an uphill struggle for Macron politically, analysts said.\\n\"Macron will continue to push a pro-business agenda, as seen in his reforms to labor laws, but further measures will likely be piecemeal and require extensive negotiation to pass,\" Zandra Kellert, associate director at consultancy Control Risks, said. \\nHis focus, she said, will be on leadership within the EU, forging relations overseas, pushing regulatory changes at the EU level, and boosting French businesses as Europe takes a more protectionist tilt.\\nRecent expenditure of his political capital will mean he is reluctant to use the executive powers he used for both the pensions bill and most recent budget, Kellert said. \"He would like to pass tax cuts and reform bureaucratic processes to make them more business-friendly. However, such measures are likely to be watered down before implementation,\" she added.\\nJulien Hoez, a political analyst\\xa0and consultant who has worked with Macron\\'s Renaissance party, said the president had not been left as a lame duck and would still be able to work constructively to accomplish some of his agenda.\\nOn a popularity level, he said, a consistent issue for Macron is that he is seen by the public as condescending — something he\\'s attempting to slowly change through media appearances where he appeals directly to the people.\\nWhile the pensions overhaul has eroded his image with those who fiercely oppose the measure, Hoez said many people were also unimpressed with the rowdiness of opposition lawmakers during the process; and that a newly-announced 2 billion euros ($2.14 billion) in tax cuts aimed at the middle class could garner Macron some favor.\\nHis government will also be under pressure to bring down inflation, which has fallen to a 12-month low but remains well above target, ahead of the test of European parliamentary elections next year.\\nRahman of Eurasia Group said that in the coming months, Macron was likely to \"win some\" — in defense and his green industry bill — and \"lose some,\" on migration.\\n\"This will set the pattern for his remaining four years in office: he will not be completely powerless or hamstrung, but he will have to choose his battles carefully,\" Rahman said.\\n',\n",

National security officials outside the DOJ have also emphasized China as a top cybersecurity concern, including the U.S.\\' top cybersecurity official.\\nThe announcement made no mention of Chinese cyber efforts, which CISA Director Jen Easterly described last week as an \"epoch-defining threat.\" But in a separate event Tuesday at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, Olsen emphasized the work that the DOJ has been doing to combat Chinese cyber efforts.\\n\"China has compromised telecommunications firms,\" Olsen said at the event. \"It conducts cyber intrusions targeting journalists and dissidents in order to suppress the free flow of information. And the PRC is capable of launching cyberattacks that could disrupt U.S. critical infrastructure.\"\\nConcerns over corporate and industrial espionage have long been a concern for top government and corporate executives, especially as Chinese concerns seek to leapfrog and develop equivalent technology, allegedly off the backs of U.S. innovation or research.\\nLast month, the Secretary of the Navy confirmed the Navy had been \"impacted\" by a China-backed hacking group that was seeking intelligence and data.\\nThe release did emphasize the threat posed by Russian malware and ransomware groups, which researchers and practitioners characterize as potent but less coordinated and less strategic than incursions from China.\\nWhile Chinese hacking groups have \"lived off the land,\" gathering intelligence and data, Russian and North Korean groups often seek to extort their victims for profit, generating revenue for themselves or their governments.\\nBuilding cases against those groups can take years, and don\\'t always result in an arrest, given the far-flung nature of the hacking groups.\\n\"NatSec Cyber will serve as an incubator, able to invest in the time-intensive and complex investigative work for early-stage cases,\" Olsen said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'A 20-year-old Russian hacker was part of a campaign that worked to extort tens of millions of dollars from more than 1,400 victims, federal prosecutors said Thursday.\\nRuslan Astamirov, a citizen of the Russian-controlled Chechen Republic, was arrested by federal law enforcement at an unspecified date and faces charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and ransoming, New Jersey federal prosecutors said.\\nAstamirov allegedly deployed ransomware called LockBit to steal sensitive data from the servers of businesses, then lock those systems and demand payment of hundreds of thousands of dollars. If the victims didn\\'t pay, Astarimov allegedly threatened to release the data.\\nDepartment of Justice prosecutors allege Astamirov was directly responsible for five different attacks against U.S. businesses in Florida and Virginia, as well as international businesses based in France, Japan and Kenya. \\nAt least one of the victims paid $700,000, the complaint says. Another victim refused to pay, and Astamirov uploaded its data to LockBit\\'s public server, according to the complaint.\\nLockBit-powered attacks account for 16% of ransomware attacks against state and local governments, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\"In securing the arrest of a second Russian national affiliated with the LockBit ransomware, the Department has once again demonstrated the long arm of the law. We will continue to use every tool at our disposal to disrupt cybercrime, and while cybercriminals may continue to run, they ultimately cannot hide,\" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said.\\nLockBit was first identified in January 2020 on Russian-language cybercrime forums. It\\'s part of a class of hacking methods and technologies dubbed ransomware as a service (RaaS).\\nIn RaaS, a technical team of developers exploits and maintains software to penetrate corporate or individual computers, then end users buy the software and deploy it against corporate networks. The end users pay either a fee or a percentage of their profits to the technical group behind LockBit.\\nAstamirov will face a federal judge Thursday, prosecutors said in a release announcing his arrest. He\\'s the third Russia-linked individual to be charged with crimes related to using LockBit.\\nHis arrest comes as cybersecurity matters grow in size and importance. NBC News reported Thursday on a widespread cyberattack that has affected \"several\" federal agencies. CNBC previously reported on how a China-backed cyber group compromised U.S. Navy systems, according to Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro.\\n',\n",

Users can use their eyes and hands to navigate through apps and search with their voices. The headset can be used to watch movies, including in 3-D, with spatial audio, view their own pictures or videos, and play video games. It can also be used for work with video conferencing apps, Microsoft Office tools or Adobe Lightroom.\\nIt will be available starting at $3,499 beginning early next year.\\nApple stock dropped about 1% after the company unveiled the headset, giving up gains from earlier in the day.\\nWith a feature called EyeSight, the headset can become transparent or opaque to signal to people around the headset user if they\\'re immersed in an experience or available to interact. Spatial audio will make it feel like the user is totally immersed in the experience, including by sensing other items in the room.\\nThe Vision Pro can also create a realistic-looking avatar of a user to use in the experience.\\nThe headset is made to fit different face shapes and sizes with adjustable and interchangeable parts.\\nThe company announced several partnerships for the Vision Pro on stage. Disney CEO Bob Iger appeared on stage to announce that Disney+ would be available on the Vision Pro from day one of its release. Unity stock spiked over 20% and trading was briefly halted after Apple announced a partnership with the game development platform.\\nHere are some images from Apple\\'s presentation that shows how it works:\\nThis is how the headset looks when a user is available to interact with others in the room.\\nApps appear in front of the user, who can look around and gesture to navigate.\\nHere\\'s what it looks like to view a panorama with the headset.\\nThis is what it would look like to play a video game on the device.\\nThis is what it\\'s like to video conference with the headset.\\nIt can also be used to learn new things in 3-D.\\nUsers can view different windows in front of them like they typically see on a computer screen.\\nApple has worked on headset hardware and software since at least 2016 in a division called the Technology Development Group. Monday\\'s launch is the culmination of years of development — some in secret, and some as public-facing groundwork previously released for the iPhone, such as depth-sensing cameras and software.\\nApple CEO Tim Cook has spoken at length about the potential of augmented reality that overlays computer graphics onto the real world, saying that the tech could eventually be an everyday device for most people and that its impact could be similar to the invention of the internet.\\nApple\\'s VR headset debut comes during a time when the broader virtual reality industry has struggled to meet high expectations for the technology. For now, it\\'s considered to be \"mixed reality,\" or virtual reality that can access the outside world through cameras mounted on the headset.\\nMonday\\'s launch also opens up a new era of open competition between Apple and Meta, which develops its own virtual reality headsets.

       "    'content': 'Kids and teens under 18 years old in Louisiana may soon need their parents\\' permission to sign up for online accounts, including for social media, gaming and more, under a newly passed bill in the state.\\nThe measure, which still needs to be signed by the state\\'s governor to take effect, follows a trend of laws in conservative states such as Utah and Arkansas that seek to limit adolescents\\' unrestricted access to social media. Liberal states such as California as well as some Democratic lawmakers in Congress have also been working on new regulations to protect kids from some of the harmful effects of social media.\\nWhile protecting kids on the internet is a value shared across the board, tech companies and many civil society groups that oppose the industry in other matters have warned such legislation ignores the positive effects social media can have, particularly for marginalized youth. They also warn new restrictions could have unintended harmful effects on kids, such as limiting the resources they have to turn to for help out of a negative home life and forcing tech platforms to collect more information on both kids and adults to ensure compliance based on age.\\nStill, the unanimous vote in both chambers of the Louisiana state legislature underscores the popularity of legislation aimed at protecting kids from online harms.\\nThe bill would also clarify agreements minors made when they signed up for existing accounts can be rendered null. The state code already says parents or legal guardians can rescind contracts their kids sign up for.\\nNetChoice, a group that represents internet platforms including Amazon, Google, Meta and TikTok, said it opposes the Louisiana bill and hopes the governor will veto it. NetChoice is currently\\xa0suing the state of California\\xa0for its Age-Appropriate Design Code that has similar aims to protect kids from online harms, due to alleged First Amendment issues. NetChoice Vice President and General Counsel Carl Szabo said in a statement that the Louisiana bill would also violate the First Amendment.\\n\"It will decimate anonymous browsing and gaming — requiring citizens to hand over data to prove their identity and age just to use an online service. Anonymity can be important for individuals using social media services for things like whistleblowers, victims, and those identifying crime in the neighborhood who fear backlash,\" Szabo said. \"What\\'s worse is that it fails to really address the underlying issues. Instead, Louisiana policymakers could actually help teens and parents by following the educational approaches of Virginia and Florida.\"\\nThe office of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards did not immediately respond to CNBC\\'s request for comment on the bill. If he chooses to sign it, it will take effect in August 2024.\\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.\\nWATCH: Sen.

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nLast year, Anthony Velez, CEO of Bagriculture, a small business selling pre-owned designer handbags, made up to $100,000 a month across his seven brick-and-mortar stores in New York City.\\nThis year, business is much different: Velez has closed all of his physical locations, but he\\'s generating up to $100,000 a day.\\nThe secret to his success, he told CNBC, has been diving into the world of livestream shopping.\\n\"All the metrics exceed any other form of shopping I\\'ve seen – period,\" Velez said. \"We can go live on three to four platforms simultaneously.\"\\nThe trend involves a seller broadcasting live video of themselves showing and explaining products while viewers ask questions and make purchases in real time. Livestream shopping started on social media in China, and according to Coresight Research, has grown into a $512 billion market.\\nThat market size might explain why some major platforms are rushing to grab a piece of the action here in the U.S.\\n\"Poshmark, eBay, TikTok. [I\\'ve gotten] nonstop phone calls,\" Velez said. \"TikTok flew in from China to meet with us.\"\\nIn its most recent quarterly report, Coresight Research, which tracks the livestreaming e-commerce industry globally, projected that U.S. livestream sales would reach $32 billion by the end of 2023. However, CEO Deborah Weinswig told CNBC the firm has since revised that projection.\\nThe original estimate was set early this year, she said, and\\xa0didn\\'t fully take into account\\xa0South Korean internet giant Naver\\'s\\xa0acquisition of\\xa0Poshmark.\\xa0At the time,\\xa0TikTok Shops, a way for users to buy products within the app without having to go to a separate e-commerce store,\\xa0was also\\xa0still getting its footing.\\nNow, \"we believe that livestreaming sales in the U.S. could easily reach $50 billion this year,\" Weinswig said. The firm also estimates livestream shopping will account for more than 5% of total e-commerce sales in the U.S. by 2026.\\nTikTok, Poshmark and eBay all told CNBC they\\'re currently testing livestream shopping.\\n\"We\\'re really bullish for the growth of this new way to shop,\" said eBay\\'s chief product officer, Eddie Garcia. \"The sky\\'s the limit … and we\\'re gonna keep learning. We\\'re going to keep investing.\"\\nGarcia, who oversees eBay Live, the company\\'s livestreaming platform, said it is currently focused on fashion and collectibles, with plans to expand from there.\\n\"We have 134 million buyers all around the globe who are chomping at the bit and really thrilled to engage with sellers in this new way,\" Garcia said.\\nMeanwhile Velez said he\\'s still fine-tuning his deals with the platforms, which involves handing over some of his earnings. Right now, he pays between 13% and 20% of each sale to cover things like payment processing and promotions.\\n\"We give a percentage our sale in exchange for visibility, ease of use,\" he said.\\nInfluencer Danielle Santana hosts live shopping shows on Amazon, selling products from other businesses — everything from cheese graters to make-up sponges. She said she gets a cut of every transaction.\\nSantana, who can sell 500 to 3,000 items in one show, told CNBC she made six figures just on Amazon Live last year.\\n\"[My commission] ranges from 2% to upwards of 20% – and that all depends on the category and the items that you are selling,\" she said.\\nSantana is one of hundreds broadcasting on the platform every day. A spokesperson for Amazon said in an email that \"thousands of creators\" livestreamed throughout the e-commerce site\\'s Prime Day event in July of last year.\\nAnd while some major platforms are jumping into livestreaming, one social media giant is pulling out.\\nA spokesperson for Facebook and Instagram parent Meta told CNBC by email the company made the \"hard decision\" to end support for its Live Shopping feature in March.\\nPreviously, according to Instagram, businesses and creators were able to tag products when they went live on the platform, allowing viewers to buy or save products added to the shopping video.\\n\"Businesses will still be able to use live broadcasting but the ability to tag products will be going away. This allows us to focus on experiences that provide more value for people and businesses like Reels and Ads that help with product discovery,\" the company spokesperson said.\\nAccording to Coresight\\'s Weinswig, Meta is \"missing out.\"\\n\"It could ultimately impact the number of eyeballs, which will impact the advertising dollars. They will also not benefit from the sales being concentrated on their platform,\" Weinswig said. \"Even the bigger miss for [Meta] will be the community, which will look elsewhere to shop and converse and learn from each other.\"\\nWeinswig estimates that companies working to establish themselves with livestreaming could see upward of 25% top-line growth.\\nSo, who is poised to emerge victorious in the livestreaming battle?\\nAccording to Weinswig, it\\'s TikTok, which has a significant opportunity in the U.S. market given its 150 million monthly active users and popularity with younger consumers.\\nThe platform\\'s technological advantage over its competitors enables it to target users with products they may be interested in purchasing.\\nWeinswig also noted that TikTok has streamlined the shopping process for users, keeping livestreams and purchases all in-feed — without leaving the app.\\n',\n",

Court deliberations are scheduled to continue in the case next month, according to the Journal.\\nOther companies have also taken steps to filter content that reaches Hong Kong. Disney has chosen not to bring two episodes of \"The Simpsons\" that include references to critiques of the Chinese government to its streaming service in Hong Kong, the Journal reported.\\nAnd Apple updated the privacy policy on its internet browser late last year to say it may use a tool from China-based Tencent to warn users in Hong Kong of malicious links, a service it\\'s relied on from Google in the past. According to The Wall Street Journal, Hong Kong users have reported that Tencent\\'s tool temporarily blocked access to legitimate Western sites like Twitter competitor Mastodon, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and coding website GitLab.\\nThese incidents come amid a rocky relationship between the governments of the U.S. and China. Some U.S. platforms, like Facebook and Google, don\\'t operate in China due to its restrictions on free expression. While Hong Kong has long served as a hub for international business that\\'s been able to allow a freer flow of information, actions by the Chinese government in recent years have made its future more uncertain.\\nThe Journal pointed to an American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong survey from March that found 38% of respondents were either optimistic or very optimistic that Hong Kong could maintain free access to the world internet over the next three years.\\n\"We remain committed to making information accessible to users,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC. \"Although we\\'re still in the early phases of building out Bard and expanding its language capabilities, we will look for ways to bring it to more places and people around the world.\"\\nRepresentatives for Apple, Disney, Microsoft, OpenAI and Tencent did not immediately respond to CNBC\\'s requests for comment.\\nRead more at The Wall Street Journal.\\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.\\nWATCH: Why China\\'s cracking down on tech — and what\\'s next\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Fox News has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Tucker Carlson, alleging that the conservative network\\'s former star anchor breached his contract by launching a new show on Twitter, according to a source familiar with the matter.\\nCarlson, a firebrand right-wing media personality known for spreading conspiracy theories, parted ways with Fox News in late April, days after the network agreed to pay almost $800 million to Dominion Voting Systems to avert a high-stakes defamation trial.\\n\"Fox News continues to ignore the interests of its viewers, not to mention its shareholder obligations,\" Harmeet Dhillon, one of Carlson\\'s lawyers, said in a statement. \"Doubling down on the most catastrophic programming decision in the history of the cable news industry, Fox is now demanding that Tucker Carlson be silent until after the 2024 election.\\xa0\\n\"Tucker will not be silenced by anyone,\" she added.\\nThe news of the cease-and-desist letter was first reported by\\xa0Axios.\\xa0NBC News has not seen the letter, but the source familiar with the matter confirmed that all the details in the Axios report were accurate. Top spokespeople at Fox News did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\\nThe first installment of Carlson\\'s new show, \"Tucker on Twitter,\" debuted June 6. In a roughly 10-minute video monologue titled \"Ep. 1,\" he claimed without evidence that Ukraine perpetrated an attack on a large dam in Russian-occupied territory and characterized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in terms that\\xa0the Anti-Defamation League called antisemitic.\\nCarlson will address the federal indictment of former President Donald Trump in the next episode of the show, set to premiere Tuesday, according to his producer. Trump is slated to be arraigned in federal court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon.\\nMore from NBC News:\\nIn a separate letter\\xa0to Carlson\\'s lawyers last week that did not expressly demand he stop posting videos on Twitter, Fox News general counsel Bernard Gugar said the former prime-time host was \"in breach\" of his contract with the network. The contract, signed in November 2019 and amended in February 2021, limits his ability to appear on other media outlets.\\nIn a statement, Bryan Freedman — another attorney for Carlson — insisted that any legal action by Fox News would infringe on the television personality\\'s First Amendment rights.\\n\"Fox defends its very existence on freedom of speech grounds,\" Freedman said. \"Now they want to take Tucker Carlson\\'s right to speak freely away from him because he took to social media to share his thoughts on current events.\"\\nThe conflict between Fox News and Carlson comes at an inflection point for the conservative media ecosystem.\\xa0\\nFox\\'s ratings in the 8 p.m. programming block once occupied by Carlson have lagged since his exit, and the network faces competition from upstart right-wing news sources such as One America News Network (OANN) and Newsmax.\\nMeanwhile, Twitter owner Elon Musk is attempting to present the social media service as a welcome home for other commentators. He tweeted after Carlson posted the first episode of his program that it \"would be great to have shows from all parts of the political spectrum on this platform!\"\\nCarlson\\'s ouster from Fox News shocked the overlapping worlds of politics and media. \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" a cornerstone of the Fox News lineup since 2016, was one of the most-watched shows on American cable news.\\nHe established himself as one of the most influential figures in a conservative political coalition reshaped by Trump. The TV host regularly drew controversy for incendiary statements about race, immigration, LGBTQ rights and other topics.\\nIn the lead-up to the Dominion trial, Carlson\\'s internal communications were released and showed him\\xa0criticizing Trump\\xa0and acknowledging that claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election were baseless. Carlson later\\xa0backtracked.\\n\\n',\n",

And the more we innovate, the more we grow.\"\\n\"I want to make the U.K. not just the intellectual home but the geographical home of global AI safety regulation,\" Sunak added.\\nThe U.K. is trying to compete with global giants in the arena of AI, one of the most-hyped areas of tech currently in the advent of OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.\\nSeparately, the country is also pitching itself as the \"next Silicon Valley,\" with Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt making several reforms to the country\\'s financial regulations to encourage more venture capital investment and listings from high-growth technology firms.\\nMuch of the most commercially advanced work around the technology is originating from the U.S., with major companies such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI, and other tech giants, such as Google (which bought U.K.-based AI company DeepMind in 2014) and Meta, making huge investments in generative AI in particular.\\nHowever, the U.K. is trying to make measures of its own to be more of a leader in the world of AI. The government in March published a white paper detailing its plan for AI regulation, which sought to take a principles-based approach to the technology rather than proposing new tailored regulations.\\nSunak last week announced the first global AI safety summit in the U.K. later this year, looking to make a bold commitment on Britain\\'s position in the global regulatory discourse surrounding the technology as officials in the U.S., European Union and beyond seek to get a handle on AI.\\nLast month, the CEOs of OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Anthropic made a visit to the U.K., speaking with the prime minister about their approach to ensuring safe development of AI. Leaders in AI are trying to convince officials that they are keeping safety in mind when creating advanced AI models.\\nThere is currently no concrete regulation for AI in any major developed nation. The European Union is seeking to change that with the EU AI Act, which lawmakers are due to vote on in Parliament later this week. But these are laws that are unlikely to come into force until well into the future.\\nThe U.K. has seen some of its most decorated tech firms sour on the country as a place to begin a tech business, with the critical Cambridge-based chip design firm Arm opting to list in New York over London earlier this year, and the CEO of Revolut saying he would \"never list\" in London citing an unfavorable tax regime and bureaucratic regulation.\\nSunak defied naysayers about the U.K. technology prospects on Monday. In a conversation with the CEO of Google DeepMind, Demis Hassabis, Sunak said that Britain is \"already a great place to scale up a tech business.\"\\n\"Over the last decade, [there have been] more unicorns in this country than anywhere other than the U.S. and China. I think that\\'s a pretty good record and a good base for us to start from, but obviously we need to keep doing well, we need to keep pushing ourselves.\"\\n\"Something like half of all of our fastest-growing innovation businesses have a foreign-born founder, so that tells you you need a visa system that attracts the best and the brightest to the U.K. And I think we\\'ve got one.\"\\nHassabis, who recently was promoted to lead Google\\'s AI research efforts, said he has seen the culture around fostering entrepreneurship in the U.K. change over the years.\\n\"When we started DeepMind back in 2010, things were very different then. I remember our first investors, who were U.S.-based, and we had to go to the U.S. to get our first investment, sort of suspicious of if you could build huge deep tech companies anywhere other than Silicon Valley.\\n\"I think it is a lot easier to start and grow very difficult and very meaningful, the tech companies. So you know, it\\'s been great to see that I think there\\'s a huge opportunity to come here.\"\\nWATCH: Can China\\'s ChatGPT clones give it an edge over the U.S. in an A.I. arms race?\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., who opposed a package of bills seeking to reform antitrust law to rein in Big Tech companies, will become the top Democrat on the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., announced Wednesday.\\nCNBC first reported that Correa was the top contender for the role, despite his voting record on antitrust deviating from that of his predecessor. Former Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who stepped down from Congress earlier this month to lead a philanthropic group, previously led the subcommittee with an emphasis on cracking down on what he viewed as digital monopolies.\\nCorrea\\'s elevation to the top Democratic seat on the subcommittee marks a likely change in tone. That shift was already set in motion on the Republican side, when the top champion of the tech reform bills, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., was passed over for the chairmanship in favor of Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. Buck had previously served as the top Republican on the subcommittee.\\nWhile Correa\\'s new role likely won\\'t result in immediate changes given that Republicans control the House and the ability to set committee agendas, some opponents fear his ascension could make it harder to replace him should Democrats take back the House in the next election.\\nWhen he was chair, Cicilline spearheaded an investigation into Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook which found the four maintained monopoly power. It resulted in a package of bills to limit their power that passed through the subcommittee under Cicilline\\'s stewardship. But Correa and other California lawmakers on the subcommittee voted against the bills.\\nCorrea gained the support of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for the position, Punchbowl News reported last week, noting, \"Only two Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus currently serve on the Judiciary Committee, even though many of the issues that it covers disproportionately impact Latino communities. Elevating Congressman Correa to Ranking Member would help ensure that the voices of the largest ethnic minority in the country would be well represented on some of the issues that matter most to them.\"\\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.\\nWATCH: Here\\'s why some experts are calling for a breakup of Big Tech after the House antitrust report\\n',\n",

Musk told CNBC\\'s David Faber in May that as an \"aspirational\" free speech absolutist, he defends a \"community notes\" model to protect users on the platform.\\n\"My overall kind of vision for actual Twitter is to be a cybernetic collective mind for humanity,\" said Musk. \"You can think of community notes as like an error correction on information in the network. And the effect of community notes is actually bigger than it would seem. It\\'s bigger than the number of notes because if somebody knows that they\\'re going to get noted they are less likely to say something that is false, because it\\'s embarrassing to get community noted.\"\\nThe debate over a community notes approach is that it leaves the burden on those affected by hate speech to report harmful posts. GLAAD says this approach causes \"sheer traumatic psychological impact of being relentlessly exposed to slurs and hateful conduct.\"\\nSo far in 2023, GLAAD has documented more than 160 acts or threats of violence at LGBTQ events. GLAAD\\'s recent Accelerating Acceptance report found that 86% of non-LGBTQ Americans agree that exposure to online hate content leads to real-world violence.\\n\"There is an urgent need for effective regulatory oversight of the tech industry — and especially social media companies — with the goal of protecting LGBTQ people, and all people,\" said GLAAD\\'s senior director of social media safety, Jenni Olson.\\nGLAAD is calling on social media platforms to take responsibility for ineffective policies, products and algorithms that create a dangerous environment for LGBTQ users, adding that actions from the platforms are limited because \"enragement leads to profitable engagement.\"\\nOlson added that social media industry leaders \"continue to prioritize corporate profits over the public interest.\"\\n\"As many of the companies behind these platforms recognize Pride month,\" said Ellis. \"They should recognize their roles in creating a dangerous environment for LGBTQ Americans and urgently take meaningful action.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nThe chief of staff to the new top Democrat on the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust lobbied on behalf of Amazon and Apple as recently as 2022, including on the very issues the ranking member will oversee in his new role, CNBC found based on public disclosures.\\nThe background of California Democrat Lou Correa\\'s top staffer is likely to further upset progressives who supported efforts to reform the rules of the road around digital competition. René Muñoz has served as chief of staff to Correa since November 2022, according to Congress tracking site LegiStorm.\\nBefore that, Muñoz worked at the lobbying firm Federal Street Strategies beginning in May 2020, according to LinkedIn, where his clients included Amazon and Apple, along with other corporations. Earlier, he worked for other Democratic representatives in Congress.\\nIn 2019, when the Democrats were in the majority, Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline spearheaded a major investigation into the competition practices of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, and hauled their CEOs before Congress. He introduced a package of bills to limit their power. Correa voted against the legislation.\\nRep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., later became the top Republican on the subcommittee and was a significant ally to Cicilline in championing the tech antitrust bills. However, once Republicans took control of the House, Buck was passed over and libertarian Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., was chosen to lead the committee.\\nThe tech industry is likely to cheer the shift from antitrust reform advocates like Cicilline and Buck as a reprieve from years of fighting against bills they saw as overly broad or having undue consequences on consumer privacy.\\nDemand Progress communications director Maria Langholz called Correa\\'s elevation to the role \"a profound disappointment,\" in a statement after his selection was announced, citing his opposition to a package of tech antitrust bills championed by Cicilline, who recently left Congress and vacated the spot.\\nIt\\'s \"embarrassing that House Democrats failed to step up and fill the void that was left by Rep. Cicilline\\'s departure from the subcommittee,\" added the progressive advocacy group\\'s spokesperson. \\n\"The Congressman\\'s Chief of Staff has spent nearly two decades in public service, most of which being spent in the halls of Congress,\" a Correa spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC on which Muñoz was copied.\\n\"He\\'s fought tirelessly to serve elected representatives from every corner of the country in their missions to uplift their constituents, and better the lives of every working family. It\\'s because of that unwavering commitment and history of service that Congressman Correa brought him aboard his team — to work by his side in his fight for the hard-working taxpayers he represents right here in Orange County,\" the statement said.\\nPublic disclosures show that as recently as 2022, Muñoz lobbied Congress on the very areas which Correa is now overseeing.\\nCorrea\\'s ability to influence the agenda while in the minority is limited, but ranking members can often serve an important role in pushing back on the majority or in messaging to industry and agencies. Some fear that should the Democrats take back the House, it will now be harder to replace Correa with a more reform-minded Democrat.\\nThe disclosures do not indicate which specific bills Muñoz lobbied on. However, in filings across multiple quarters, he is listed as one of three lobbyists for Federal Street Strategies who worked on issue areas related to several of the bills that passed through the House Judiciary Committee while Cicilline led the antitrust subcommittee.\\nFor example, in the second and third quarters of 2021, Muñoz is listed as one of three lobbyists who engaged with Congress on behalf of Apple in areas related to the six bills that made up Cicilline\\'s cornerstone package on tech antitrust. That includes the period right around the time that package passed through the House Judiciary Committee in June 2021.\\nLobbying disclosures by Federal Street indicate that Muñoz was similarly one of three lobbyists who engaged on behalf of Amazon on areas related to those bills during the same period.\\nAmong the bills in the package were the Ending Platform Monopolies Act, which could lead to a breakup of dominant online platforms by prohibiting them from owning business lines that present a conflict of interest. \\nThey also included the American Choice and Innovation Online Act, which would prohibit top platforms from favoring their own products over rivals\\' in their marketplaces or discriminating against competitors. It was the precursor to a Senate version of the bill that gained steam last year by passing out of the Judiciary committee in that chamber. But it ultimately failed to reach the floor after significant tech lobbying.\\nAgain, it\\'s unclear from the filing which exact bills Muñoz lobbied on.\\nThe tech industry and its trade groups have spent millions on lobbying, including against antitrust bills that would restrict key elements of their business models. Apple notably ramped up its overall lobbying spending in 2022, reaching $9.4 million, a 44% increase compared to the prior year. Its fourth-quarter filing showed it lobbied on antitrust bills as well as online privacy issues, taxes, semiconductor policy and more.\\nAmazon spent the most of the tech giants in 2022, coming in at $19.7 million. The e-commerce giant also lobbied on tech antitrust as well as issues around cloud computing and counterfeit goods.\\nWATCH: Here\\'s how the lobbying industry works\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nFor months, Meta has been working on a Twitter-like, text-based social media network that would compete with Twitter and the bevy of clone apps that have gained prominence since Elon Musk took Twitter private in 2022. News of the plans have inspired a public spat between Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, culminating in a joking challenge to engage in a physical \"cage match\" fight in Las Vegas.\\nMeta previously confirmed to CNBC that it was \"exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text updates,\" but didn\\'t offer further details on the nature or name of the app.\\nMeta enjoys a significant advantage over upstart competitors like BlueSky or Mastodon, given how many users are already integrated into Facebook and Instagram. It also enjoys longstanding relationships with brands and advertisers which could provide revenue at launch.\\nBut given deep cuts to trust and safety teams at Meta and throughout the social media industry, content moderation may prove to be a challenge. Many advertisers fled Twitter after controversial content surged in the wake of Musk\\'s acquisition. At Meta, which has faced scrutiny over its amplification of misinformation, similar concerns may undercut its ability to entice advertisers en masse to a new offering.\\nHere\\'s what\\'s been reported so far.\\nThe app is codenamed Project 92 or P92, Platformer reported in March, and Meta is considering calling it Threads, according to a June report from the Verge. It will reportedly be deeply integrated into Instagram, populating information from the existing social media platform. A top Meta executive reportedly said that high-profile users, including celebrities an content creators, were looking for a \"sanely run\" platform.\\nA screenshot shows an SSO, or single-sign on feature, with the words \"Log in with Instagram\" on the landing screen.\\nMeta clearly believes it can lever its existing relationships with institutions, celebrities, and news organizations to attract users and content generators, which in turn would feed advertising revenue and revitalize an aging user base.\\nRenders obtained by the Verge show a user interface that is uncannily similar to Twitter\\'s feed, with iconography and symbols that mirror Instagram\\'s current user interface. The familiar UI will likely make it easier for users to grapple with a reported integration with ActivityPub, a social media protocol designed to promote \"decentralized\" social networks, allowing different platforms to effectively connect with each other.\\nThe integration means that systems that also run on ActivityPub, like Twitter-competitor Mastodon, would have interconnectivity with Project 92. A render shared by the Verge prominently showcases that integration.\\nMeta chief product officer Chris Cox reportedly said the company was engaging with public figures, including the Dalai Lama and Oprah Winfrey, about joining the platform at launch. The Dalai Lama has over two million followers on Instagram; Winfrey has over 23 million. High-profile power users would give Meta a monetizable and captive audience from the outset, and could help propel the app ahead of Twitter.\\nThe company began building the platform in January, a few months after Musk took over Twitter, and Meta plans for the app to be available this summer, according to reports in Bloomberg and elsewhere.\\n',\n",

Nvidia had already created a version of the A100, its popular AI chip, that it could sell to the Chinese market. The A800 was made to stay within performance parameters previously outlined by the Commerce Department.\\nBut the new limits reportedly being considered by the Biden administration would restrict even those sales without a license.\\nSuch a move would continue the ongoing standoff between the U.S. and Chinese governments on technology sales between the two countries.

       "    'content': 'Saudi Arabia sees China as a key partner in a multipolar world — with the two countries expected to only come closer as their common interests grow, Saudi Minister of Investment Khalid Al-Falih told CNBC.\\n\"This is, in a way, a multipolar global order that has emerged — it\\'s not emerging. China is a significant player in it,\" Al-Falih told CNBC\\'s Dan Murphy during the Arab-China Business Conference in Riyadh Tuesday, now in its 10th year.\\nA multipolar world in this context signifies a global system that isn\\'t dominated by the West or defined as a struggle between two major powers, as it was during the Cold War.\\n\"We like to believe, and I think it\\'s been proven, that the kingdom is a significant part of this multipolar world that has emerged. And we\\'re going to play our part, not only in developing our own economy, but also developing our region, and spreading what we have in terms of development opportunities, also to Africa, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent,\" he said. \"And we believe that economic cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia and the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), and the entire Arab region, will be a significant part of that.\"\\nThe post-Cold War period saw the United States exist as the preeminent world power, the strongest force on the planet in terms of economic, military, and geopolitical might. The rise of China and the BRICS (other emerging markets that include Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa), as well as anger in many parts of the world over U.S.-led wars and sanctions campaigns, led to increasing calls for a world order in which power was more widely distributed among different countries.\\nSaudi Arabia, in balancing its friendships with both China and the U.S., sees itself as a part of that. The kingdom has also become a much more active global player, wielding its oil-fueled financial power to supercharge its international trade and investment and gain influence around the world.\\n\"I think significantly, we see opportunities for Chinese companies and Saudi companies to also invest internationally in third countries ... in ways that will bring development to other developing countries. I think this summit signifies an increasing tendency towards south-south collaboration and partnership,\" he said, referencing the global south, \"because the south now has many centers of excellence in technology and capital, we\\'re no longer dependent on the developed north, [as] in the previous world order.\"\\nThe more than 80-year-old relationship between Riyadh and Washington is often summed up in broad terms as one of oil in exchange for security. The U.S. has military installments in Saudi Arabia, selling it advanced weaponry and providing training and joint operations with the Saudi military.\\nBut the U.S.-Saudi relationship has come under strain in recent years, as the Biden administration attempted to call out the kingdom for its human rights abuses and influence its oil production volumes, but to no avail.\\nChina, meanwhile, has for years been making inroads — especially economically — as Saudi Arabia\\'s top trading partner and the largest buyer of its oil. Riyadh\\'s relationship with Beijing is more functional and economic than strategic, though, meaning it is not likely to supplant the U.S.\\'s role in the kingdom anytime soon.\\nHowever,\\xa0Saudi Arabia in recent years has been buying more Chinese weapons, in particular the ones that Washington has been less than willing to sell its Gulf ally, like lethal drones. Technology transfers and Chinese infrastructure projects are also growing in the kingdom, as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman seeks to diversify his country\\'s alliances and make it more independent.\\nChinese President Xi Jinping visited Saudi Arabia in December, and the two countries signed a strategic partnership agreement that the Chinese foreign ministry at the time called \"an epoch-making milestone in the history of China-Arab relations.\"\\n\"I see it going into a significant shift from a trade to a core investment relationship,\" Al-Falih said of his country\\'s ties with Beijing. \\n\"We already invest significantly in China, mostly in oil refining and petrochemicals. But there have been other investments in technology by the PIF (Saudi Arabia\\'s sovereign wealth fund), and by other private sector companies. But we would see, going forward, more global champions from Saudi Arabia going to China to access a growing market of 1.4 billion high-consumption individuals.\"\\nNotably, the Arab-China conference was held just days after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken\\'s visit to Riyadh. Al-Falih shrugged off the idea that its growing ties to China were a threat to the U.S.\\n\"Saudi Arabia is going to be a partner to all of the major economies globally. And China certainly is a prominent one in that field,\" he said. \\n\"We have a fantastic relationship with the U.S., it\\'s been part of our global relationships since the creation of the modern Saudi Arabia, that is well known, and I believe it is very strong, as evidenced during the visit of President Biden last year. And I think the fact that Secretary Blinken was here last week just reinforces that strong relationship.\"\\nHe noted that the U.S. remains the kingdom\\'s largest foreign investor, saying \"I don\\'t see our relationship with the U.S., with China as being mutually exclusive. I think, in fact, they complement each other.\"\\n\"We don\\'t see disruptions and those relationships happening,\" the minister added. \"But certainly what sets our strategy is our own interests, and those interests with China are strong and rising.\"\\n',\n",

It\\'s being wielded as an economic tool for Vision 2030, a years-long project aiming at modernizing and diversifying the kingdom\\'s economy away from oil.\\nNews that the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia\\'s LIV Golf were joining forces last week brought an end to a two-year battle between the archrivals.\\nThe agreement, which includes the DP World Tour — also known as the PGA European Tour — will\\xa0combine the commercial businesses and rights of the PGA Tour and LIV Golf into a new, yet-to-be-named for-profit company.\\xa0\\nFounded in 2021 with the goal of becoming the world\\'s premier professional golf tour, LIV Golf was backed by the PIF and had lured some of the biggest golf stars away from the PGA Tour with huge paychecks. That spurred lawsuits between the two entities until the decision to merge, which ended all pending litigation.\\n\"The region is more than capable of being part of this global phenomenon, recent phenomenon of the rise in sports as part of the global economy,\" Al-Falih said of the Middle East. \"And golf is part of it, is a significant part of it, and it addresses an important segment of the population who also play and follow golf.\"\\nAs part of the PGA-LIV merger, the Saudi PIF is now the exclusive investor in the new golf entity, and it has the right of first refusal on any new investment.\\nThe PIF is rapidly expanding into sports,\\xa0hosting a Formula One Grand Prix\\xa0and major boxing matches, and\\xa0buying British Premier League soccer team Newcastle United.\\nSaudi Arabia also\\xa0lured soccer legends Cristiano Ronaldo\\xa0and\\xa0Karim\\xa0Benzema\\xa0with contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars to play in local Saudi leagues, and it\\'s expected to bid to host the 2030 World Cup.\\nIn the past few years, the mammoth PIF fund has also\\xa0bought up stakes in major blue chip companies\\xa0including Amazon, Uber, Alphabet, Microsoft, Boeing, Bank of America, Disney and Meta.\\nAl-Falih noted the power of sports to attract tourism, but also to offer something attractive to Saudis already in the country.\\n\"Sport is a significant component of global economy, consumption, media, digital content, which is now in our hands and laptops and something that as individuals, as households, as corporates, it\\'s part of,\" he said. \"And of course, as a minister of investment, I welcome it as an opportunity for us to create more -- Formula E, Formula One, boxing matches, football matches.\"\\n\"It\\'s part of retaining our Saudi citizens, global residents who choose Saudi Arabia as their home, to stay in Saudi Arabia and to consume this product that is of high demand,\" the minister added, \"and also to bring global followers of sport to the kingdom for the various activities and sports that will be taking place here.\"\\nNumerous human rights groups and lawmakers in other parts of the world criticize Saudi Arabia\\'s financial involvement in the sports world as \"sportswashing,\" or an effort to cleanse its image of human rights abuses.\\nSaudi Arabia has\\xa0long been criticized for its human rights record, which includes the imprisonment and execution of political dissidents, harsh penalties including death for members of the LGBT community, and the\\xa0high-profile killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi\\xa0in 2018 by Saudi agents.\\nCNBC has contacted the Saudi Foreign Ministry for comment.\\nThe kingdom\\'s aggressive campaign to promote its image as a reformed, socially liberalizing country is a key part of the crown prince\\'s Vision 2030.

       "    'content': 'PARIS — France\\'s top politicians told CNBC they see the beginnings of global regulation on artificial intelligence coming by the end of this year, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying the country wants to work with the U.S. on rules around the fast-growing technology.\\nThe comments come as interest in AI, sparked by the rapid growth of chatbot ChatGPT, continues to rise and governments around the world debate how the technology should be regulated.\\nBut there is no global consensus on how AI should be managed and controlled with the U.S., China and European Union taking different approaches to rules around the tech. Any global regulatory framework would be a huge feat.\\nFrance has looked to position itself as the European hub for AI development even as the European Union, of which France is a member, pushes forward with first-of-its kind regulation.\\nMacron, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and Digital Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, all spoke to CNBC on Wednesday at the VivaTech conference in Paris, expressing a desire for global regulation on AI.\\n\"From my point of view … I think we do need a regulation and all the players, even the U.S. players, agree with that. I think we need a global regulation,\" Macron told CNBC\\'s Karen Tso on the sidelines of the event.\\nBarrot said that by the end of the year, \"some of the core principles that we would like for the regulation of AI in G7 countries and like minded countries will start to emerge.\"\\nThe G7 includes countries such as France, Germany the U.S. and U.K. The countries agreed this year to set up a working group to look at issues that may arise from AI.\\nMacron said the G7 and the\\xa0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which includes 38 countries, would be a \"good platform\" to develop global regulation.\\nThe clamor around AI regulation has risen in part due to ChatGPT, the AI chatbot created by U.S. firm OpenAI. ChatGPT went viral last year and has sparked somewhat of an AI arms race across the globe with companies such as Google in the U.S. to Baidu and Alibaba in China announcing their own rivals.\\nMeanwhile, major leaders like Tesla CEO Elon Musk have warned of the existential threat of AI to humanity and some executives have called for a pause on the development of the technology.\\nAI has concerned governments who are already worried about the spread of disinformation online and so-called \"deepfakes\" — which are fake videos or images created by AI. Governments are still contending with the potential unintended consequences of AI development, while trying to make sure they don\\'t fall behind in the technology\\'s development.\\nFrance\\'s call for global AI regulation comes as the European Union closes in on passing an unprecedented law called the EU AI Act. The European Parliament on Wednesday approved the bloc\\'s landmark law, which looks to take a risk-based approach to regulating AI.\\nThe latest amendments to the law include a tougher stance on so-called generative AI, the type of technology that underpins OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT, which allows systems to create images or respond in text to prompts. The regulation states generative AI developers will be required to submit their systems for review before releasing them commercially.\\nThe law still needs approval from other EU bodies.\\nFrance, which has traditionally taken a pro-regulatory stance, has expressed concern that the EU law around AI has gone to far.\\n\"My worry is that in the recent past few weeks, the EU Parliament … has taken a very sort of strong stance on AI regulation, using in some sense this AI act as a way to try and solve too many problems at once,\" Barrot said on the provisions around generative AI.\\nEven as an EU-level law continues to work through the legislative process, France is pushing for regulations on a global scale and it sees the U.S. as a key ally.\\n\"Competition is always a good thing. So we have a very close cooperation with the U.S. but we also want to get access to our own AI intelligence and companies,\" Le Maire told CNBC on the sidelines of VivaTech.\\n\"On regulation as well, I think this is absolutely vital to have an in-depth discussion with the American authorities on the best way of regulating artificial intelligence,\" he added.\\nThe U.S. has not yet come up with any kind of framework for AI regulation. But American companies are some of the most prominent in the space with OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT, as well as chipmaker Nvidia being the leaders in the space.\\nMeanwhile China, which has become somewhat of a common technology rival for the EU and U.S., has introduced laws around specific uses of AI such as computer-generated content known as \"deepfakes.\"\\nFrance\\'s top politicians who spoke to CNBC discussed their focus for AI regulation.\\n\"We want to be sure that this is safe, unbiased … that the language models we have are not biased and that what is ... forbidden in society is forbidden in this model. So we need some rules,\" Macron said.\\nAI like ChatGPT is trained on huge amounts of data called large language models that allow it to understand human language and respond. But there are concerns that the data it is trained on could cause that system to inherit biases.\\nMacron also said that if you are watching a video or looking at a photo that has been created by AI, a user has a right to know.\\nUltimately, French politicians are weighing up regulation that balances the need for protecting users of the technology without stifling innovation.\\n\"What we want is a regulation that offers both protection for users … and that establishes trust, but that is also very flexible enough to allow for the development in the next few weeks, next few months in France and Europe,\" Barrot said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'When Ukraine\\'s counteroffensive started last week there was no fanfare or official announcement, but that wasn\\'t entirely unexpected.\\nKyiv had repeatedly insisted in the months up to the counteroffensive, as it pleaded for and awaited more weapons deliveries from its international allies, that it would not pre-announce the start of its actions aimed at retaking a swathe of Russian-occupied land in southern and eastern Ukraine.\\nStill, after its almost imperceptible launch and modest progress in recent days, plus reports of \"extremely heavy\" fighting and counterattacks by Russian forces around the few settlements Ukraine says it has recaptured, observers could be forgiven for feeling somewhat underwhelmed so far.\\nBut military analysts say there\\'s a reason that this latest counteroffensive is proceeding cautiously and that Kyiv has a strategy — that of probing for weaknesses along Russia\\'s long and deep defensive lines, and that larger-scale attacks are expected to follow.\\nCertainly anyone expecting more of a \"big bang\" from this counteroffensive and for Ukraine to dramatically recapture a large amount of territory in quick time — similar to earlier successful counteroffensives in the northeast Kharkiv region last September or the southern Kherson region in the fall — is likely to be disappointed, analysts said.\\n\"It is no surprise that Ukraine is being cautious,\" Nick Reynolds, research fellow for land warfare at\\xa0the London-based defense and security think tank RUSI, told CNBC Thursday.\\n\"I would say that if this counter offensive doesn\\'t ultimately result in a big bang, I don\\'t think anyone should be really surprised. Perhaps they will be able to find certain weak points and take large amounts of ground or this could be a more incremental offensive,\" he noted, warning that Russia had re-postured its armed forces for defensive operations and that they are \"much more effective on the defense.\"\\nOnly a handful of villages have been re-captured in modest advances made over the past week and there are reports that Russia is counterattacking and contesting several settlements that Ukraine has reclaimed.\\nUkraine\\'s relatively limited territorial gains so far also reaffirm previous expectations that an offensive in the south would be gradual and extremely difficult, especially without the air superiority, Andrius Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe advisor at Teneo, a political risk consultancy, told CNBC Thursday.\\n\"The Russian side has been anticipating such an offensive for months and set up multi-layered and well-equipped defensive lines in the area,\" he said.\\nDefense analysts say Ukraine is carefully trying to probe the depth of Russian defenses, including miles of trenches, anti-tank ditches, dragons\\' teeth designed to block the path of military vehicles and other fortifications, predominantly located along the front line spanning from Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine to the Donbas in the east.\\n\"Now we can see the first stage of this counteroffensive,\" Oleksandr Musiyenko, a military expert and head of the Centre for Military and Legal Studies in Kyiv, told CNBC Tuesday.\\n\"We are trying to find the weakest places in the Russian defense line. That\\'s the first point. Also what I can say is that Ukrainian forces had some success, liberating some villages and territory around Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk ... and the counteroffensive also continues around Bakhmut,\" he said.\\nUkrainian defense officials said earlier this week that seven settlements had been liberated in the last week of fighting in Donetsk and that the area of the territory now under control amounted to 90 square kilometers, or 35 square miles.\\nNonetheless, Ukraine\\'s deputy defense minister conceded Wednesday that the fighting was \"extremely fierce\" and that the counteroffensive had only had \"partial success\" so far. CNBC contacted Ukraine\\'s defense ministry for further comment and is awaiting a response.\\nMusiyenko believed bigger attacks by Ukrainian forces were on the way and was optimistic that Russian defensive lines would be broken.\\n\"We will see the main punches of Ukrainian forces in the nearest future. The main goal right now is to cut and destroy the land bridge to Crimea [referring to a swathe of land in southern and eastern Ukraine connecting mainland Russia to Russian-occupied Crimea] and to then move forward. Ukraine has also some prospects to move forward in the Donbas region and to liberate Bakhmut even.\"\\n\"So we will see bigger attacks of Ukrainian forces in the near future, and also what\\'s very important is that Russians have used all their reserves that they have already, but Ukraine hasn\\'t,\" he added.\\nUkraine has a lot to prove with this latest counteroffensive, having to show its international partners that the continued supply of NATO weaponry is worth it, used effectively and can be decisive in the outcome of the war.\\nU.S. State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that the White House would not comment on \"twists and turns of the counteroffensive or battlefield updates on what is obviously a very active and ongoing situation. We\\'ll leave that to the Ukrainian military to speak to.\"\\nRUSI\\'s Reynolds said that Western-donated weaponry wouldn\\'t radically change Ukraine\\'s performance on the battlefield, however.\\n\"I think a lot of the capabilities they\\'ve been gifted have been useful but the Ukrainian military is still working to absorb a lot of the equipment it\\'s been given, a lot of it\\'s been provided piecemeal,\" he said, noting that, as such \"we certainly shouldn\\'t have expected any radically different performance based on sort of Western equipment.\"\\nReynolds believed that much of the Western-donated equipment for Ukraine had been dictated by \"what was convenient to the donor, as opposed to what Ukraine needed.\" And on top of the question of integrating new military hardware into its military operations, Ukraine was also challenged by the absorption of a huge amount of personnel, Reynolds noted.\\n\"As [it\\'s gone from a] much smaller military to one that\\'s on a war footing, it\\'s had to take in lots of brand new personnel and it\\'s also taken very high casualties, I would say, which has resulted in further pressures,\" he said.\\nAnalysts say there is a concern that Ukraine is under too much pressure to perform for its international partners who are, ultimately, sustaining its military efforts to repel Russia over the longer-term.\\n\"The importance of Ukraine\\'s counteroffensive is high, and so are the expectations,\" Teneo\\'s Tursa noted, adding that, in this respect, \"Ukraine has partially become a victim of its successful counteroffensives in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions last year.\"\\n\"The long wait for Ukraine\\'s latest offensive and the arrival of advanced Western weapons have further raised expectations and optimism, which might prove counterproductive for Kyiv in the long run,\" he noted.\\nRUSI\\'s Reynolds agreed, noting that \"I think expectations were set very, very high ... and I think they were too high.\"\\n\"The risk is that the talk of the counteroffensive sets such unrealistic expectations that the Ukrainians are pressurised into taking operational risks, so I think perhaps a slow offensive is the smart thing to do.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Tensions have emerged this week between the Kremlin and the head of Russian private military company, the Wagner Group, as President Vladimir Putin appeared to take sides in a long-running and very public dispute between Russia\\'s mercenaries and the defense ministry.\\nIt\\'s well known that there\\'s no love lost between the outspoken Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin and Russia\\'s Ministry of Defense; Prigozhin has openly and repeatedly criticized the ministry\\'s most senior officials, including Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, in expletive-laden rants slamming Russia\\'s military strategy in Ukraine.\\nHe has also accused senior defense officials of treachery and deliberately withholding ammunition for the Wagner Group which has spent months fighting in Bakhmut, the epicenter of intense hostilities in Ukraine.\\nRead more about Russia\\'s war on Ukraine:Rescuers are braving snipers as they ferry Ukrainians from flood zonesUkraine says no peace talks with Russia before withdrawalUkraine\\'s counteroffensive has been underwhelming so farPutin extols Russian economic performance, defends spending\\nPrigozhin has been very careful not to direct any public criticism toward the Kremlin and Putin, and is one of the president\\'s long-standing associates and supporters.\\nBut now, however, tensions appear to be emerging between Prigozhin and the Russian leadership, putting him in a precarious position with the Russian president.\\nWhile Wagner has had its uses in Ukraine (and arguably, has been able to boast some gains where Russia\\'s regular army has not) Russia\\'s defense ministry has been keen to curb the group\\'s influence, and particularly that of Prigozhin.\\nThe latest move to rein in the mercenary group came last Saturday when Shoigu announced that \"volunteers formation\" and private military companies would have to sign contracts directly with the ministry by July 1.\\nThe ministry claimed that \"this will give volunteer formations the necessary legal status, create common approaches to organizing comprehensive support and fulfilment of their tasks,\" according to state news agency TASS.\\nPrigozhin reacted to the announcement with characteristic defiance, stating Sunday that \"Wagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,\" adding that the order did not apply to the Wagner Group.\\nBut then the move to enforce contracts with private military companies was explicitly endorsed by Putin on Tuesday, with the president saying he wanted the law changed to legalize their activities.\\n\"This is the only way to ensure social guarantees (for mercenary fighters) because there is (currently) no contract with the state and no contract with the Defence Ministry,\" Putin told a group of war correspondents.\\nRemarkably, despite Putin\\'s comments, Prigozhin again refused to sign any contract, saying Wednesday that \"when we began to participate in this war, no one said that we would be obliged to conclude agreements with the Ministry of Defense,\" he said on Telegram according to a translation by Google.\\nHe added that \"none of the Wagner PMC fighters is ready to go down the path of shame again.\\xa0And so no one will sign contracts.\"\\nPrigozhin has stated that he\\'s confident a compromise can be found that avoids the need for a contract with the defense ministry, but analysts say the mercenary boss is on shaky ground in his apparent defiance of Putin.\\nThe U.K\\'s defense ministry remarked on rising tensions Thursday, noting that \"for several months, Wagner owner Yevgeny Prigozhin has been aiming vitriolic criticism at the MoD [Ministry of Defense] hierarchy but deferred to Putin\\'s authority.\"\\xa0\\nNow, it noted, that \"Prigozhin\\'s rhetoric is evolving into defiance of broader sections of the Russian establishment.\" It warned that July 1— the deadline for the volunteers to sign contracts — \"is likely to be a key way-point in the feud.\"\\nPrigozhin has become an increasingly high-profile figure, entering the independent Levada Center\\'s index on Russian people\\'s trust in public figures for the first time in May — giving him a rating of 4%. This puts him on the same trust level as former President Dmitry Medvedev and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.\\nAndrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, noted Wednesday that he could find himself increasingly vulnerable as he becomes more high profile, and is seen to present a possible challenge to Putin.\\n\"Prigozhin is playing at independent politics, raising the stakes and testing the susceptibility of the system as he goes. But both technically and physically, this is only possible as long as this shaven-headed enfant terrible is useful to Putin,\" Kolesnikov said in comments published in Carnegie Politika.\\nHowever, he noted, that \"in the current political system ... Prigozhin can only be against the elite — and popular as a result — so long as he is for Putin. It would take the slightest sign from Putin for the Wagner boss to disappear from the information space (and indeed other spaces),\" he said.\\nWhile Prigozhin represents \"an emerging leader who speaks to the people without intermediaries, just as befits a populist and true leader,\" Kolesnikov said \"the only problem is that Russia already has such a leader: President Vladimir Putin.\"\\n',\n",

Turkey, Finland and Sweden had last year inked an agreement to on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Madrid, committing to address Turkey\\'s security demands.\\nAnkara\\'s objections are complex, but center mainly on Sweden\\'s support for Kurdish groups that Turkey considers to be terrorists, and on weapons embargoes that both Sweden and Finland, along with other EU countries, put on Turkey for targeting Kurdish militias in Syria.\\nErdogan also wants Sweden to crack down on protests against his government. For months, Sweden\\'s capital has seen protests built up against Turkey, which at the start of the year led to the heavily criticised burning of the holy Muslim book Quran by some demonstrators.\\n\"In order for us to comply with these expectations, first of all, Sweden must do its part,\" Erdogan said.\\nPrior to the recent elections in May, Turkey\\'s presidential spokesperson in March said that Ankara has \"left the door open\" to Stockholm\\'s bid to be a part of the military alliance \"if it shows will and determination.\"\\nOn Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden met with NATO\\'s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, emphasizing their \"shared desire to welcome Sweden to the Alliance as soon as possible,\" a White House statement said.\\n\"Obviously, our relationship is grounded in NATO. I think it will continue to be so,\" Flake said of U.S.-Turkey relations, underscoring both parties\\' security and commercial partnership.\\n\"On the commercial side, we[\\'ve] got a healthy amount of balance trade, about 33 billion as of last year. That\\'s increasing every year,\" he said.\\nThe Turkish leader has previously criticized Flake for paying a visit to Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the presidential candidate of the opposition alliance that Erdogan beat in recent elections. Flake on Friday characterized his relationship with Erdogan as being \"in a good place.\"\\nHe added, \"Sometimes it\\'s a challenging relationship.

He raised concerns as well as \"opportunities to explore cooperation,\" and he emphasized the importance of open communication, according to the statement.\\n\"The Secretary made clear that the United States will always stand up for the interests and values of the American people and work with its allies and partners to advance our vision for a world that is free, open, and upholds the international rules-based order,\" the spokesperson said.\\nBlinken invited Qin to the U.S. to continue discussions, and the spokesperson said the pair agreed to schedule a visit at a \"mutually suitable time.\" Blinken will continue to meet with Chinese officials in Beijing Monday.\\nHis original travel plans for February were disrupted by news of an alleged Chinese spy balloon flying over U.S. airspace. The U.S. ultimately shot down the alleged spy balloon, and tensions between the world\\'s two largest economies have since remained tense. Beijing insisted the balloon was an unnamed weather tracker that blew off course.\\nBlinken was set to have a working dinner later Sunday at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse with Qin, who was previously China\\'s ambassador to the U.S. Some reports suggest there may also be a meeting with President Xi Jinping on Monday during Blinken\\'s two-day visit.\\nExpectations for a significant recovery in the U.S.-China relationship, especially as a result of Blinken\\'s trip, remain low. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement last week that Blinken will discuss the importance of maintaining open lines of communication and will \"raise bilateral issues of concern, global and regional matters, and potential cooperation on shared transnational challenges.\"\\nAt the annual Shangri-La Dialogue event in Singapore earlier this month, the U.S. defense chief and his Chinese counterpart didn\\'t have a formal meeting.

       "    'content': 'Iran and Afghanistan are going head to head over control of the supply of a crucial resource that\\'s shrinking by the day: water.\\nViolence along the border between the two tumultuous countries flared up in recent weeks, stoked by a dispute over the water flowing from Afghanistan\\'s Helmand river into Iran. Tehran says Afghanistan\\'s Taliban government is deliberately depriving Iran of sufficient water supplies in order to bolster its own; but the Taliban says there isn\\'t enough water anymore to begin with, thanks to plummeting rainfall and river levels.\\nIranian and Afghan border guards clashed on May 27, exchanging heavy gunfire that killed two Iranian guards and one Taliban soldier and wounded several others. Both sides blame each other for provoking the fighting, which has thrust the region\\'s water issues back into the spotlight.\\xa0\\nThe situation risks destabilizing an already poor and water-deprived part of Iran, where serious protests against the government have taken place in recent years.\\xa0\\n\"The water dispute with Afghanistan is not something Iran can take lightly,\" Torbjorn Soltvedt, principal Middle East and North Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC. \"Water resources in Iran are under severe pressure and water stress has been a trigger of large-scale civil unrest in recent years.\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn the summer of 2021, protests began in Iran\\'s western Khuzestan province over water shortages and subsequent power outages as hydroelectric power stations ran out of supply. Dubbed \"the uprising of the thirsty,\" the demonstrations soon spread to several cities around Iran including the capital Tehran, and drew a heavy government crackdown that ended in both police and civilian casualties.\\xa0\\nGrappling with U.S. sanctions, a severely weakened economy and a continuing anti-government protest movement, Iran is already under significant pressure. \"With the authorities still struggling to keep a lid on nationwide protests,\" Soltvedt said, \"a water security crisis in eastern Iran would come at a particularly bad time.\"\\xa0\\nThe 580-mile border between Afghanistan and Iran is porous and crawling with crime, predominantly coming from the Afghan side into Iran. Afghanistan has been wracked with instability and war for decades, and the ruling Taliban government derives a significant part of its revenue from illicit trades.\\n\"Iran\\'s Afghan border has always been its most vulnerable,\" said Kamal Alam, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\\'s South Asia Center. It\\'s host to \"a number of issues including narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, and terrorism\" — but is simultaneously an all-important source for water, Alam said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWater tensions between the two countries go way back. In the 1950s, Afghanistan built two major dams that limited the flow of water from the Helmand river into Iran. This angered Tehran and threatened relations, ultimately leading to the signing of a treaty in 1973 that allotted Iran 850 million cubic meters of Helmand water yearly.\\xa0\\nBut subsequent revolutions, invasions, wars and dramatic government changes in both countries meant the treaty was never fully implemented.\\xa0\\n\"Since the 1973 water treaty between the two, they have come close to war a number of times due to various Afghan governments using Iran\\'s water vulnerability as a leverage on bilateral issues,\" Alam said.\\xa0\\nScientists have long warned that climate change increases the risk of wars and refugee crises as countries fight over the natural resources they need to live.\\xa0\\n\"The disagreements over water allotments for the Helmand River are hard to overcome because neither country has the ability to bring more water to the region,\" said Ryan Bohl, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at Rane. \"It\\'s already an extremely dry area, but issues like climate change and overfarming are making it worse.\"\\xa0\\n\"In a way,\" he said, \"it\\'s a classic driver of conflict, a competition for a scarce resource neither side can live without.\"\\nIn mid-May, a Taliban press release expressed Afghanistan\\'s support for the 1973 treaty, but said: \"Since there has been a drought in Afghanistan and the region in recent years and the water level has dropped … provinces of the country are suffering from drought and there is not enough water. In such a situation, we consider Iran\\'s frequent demand for water and inappropriate statements in the media as harmful.\"\\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi, in response, told Afghanistan\\'s leaders to take his words \"very seriously,\" saying \"I warn the rulers of Afghanistan to give the rights of the people in [the Iranian border regions of] Sistan and Baluchistan immediately.\" A Taliban commander hit back, saying there was no water for them to give Iran and warning, \"Do not attack us. We are not afraid.\"\\nTehran then made a statement emphasizing the fact that it doesn\\'t recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan\\'s ruling body. The back-and-forth only heightened tensions, and some worry that May\\'s border shootout could be a sign of worse to come.\\xa0\\nRane\\'s Bohl expects the issue to fester as \"water scarcity is a very complicated problem that requires extensive and expensive infrastructure investments to overcome, neither of which heavily-sanctioned Iran or Afghanistan is in a position to fix,\" he said.\\xa0\\nHe expects flare-ups between the two to continue, as well as continued interruptions to Afghanistan\\'s water supply — bad news for an already desperately impoverished country.\\nThat \"could harm Afghanistan\\'s farming output over time and damage its already frail economy and worsen food shortages,\" Bohl said.\\n\\n',\n",

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on China\\'s statement.\\nRobert Daly, director of the Wilson Center\\'s Kissinger Institute on China and the U.S., acknowledged that the likelihood of war is low, but said the rivalry will go on.\\n\"There\\'s a joint decision, a joint realization that we mustn\\'t go to war, but both countries are going to keep competing in every index of power all over the world, by all means short of war,\" Daly told CNBC before Xi\\'s meeting with Blinken.\\nBlinken also said he raised concerns about China\\'s \"provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait, as well as in the South and East China Seas.\"\\nBut he sought to assure Beijing: \"On Taiwan, I reiterated the longstanding U.S. \\'one China\\' policy.\\xa0That policy has not changed.\"\\nChina considers Taiwan part of its territory that needs to be reunified with the mainland. Beijing has never renounced the use of force against Taiwan and has been using increasingly aggressive rhetoric toward the island.\\n\"We do not support Taiwan independence.\\xa0We remain opposed to any unilateral changes to the status quo by either side.\\xa0We continue to expect the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences,\" said Blinken adding that Washington remains committed to the Taiwan Relations Act, including making sure that Taiwan has the ability to defend itself.\\nIn his meeting with Blinken on Monday, Wang emphasized that \"safeguarding national unity will always be the core of China\\'s core interests.\" He added that the U.S. must \"respect China\\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and clearly oppose \\'Taiwan independence.\\'\"\\nGeopolitical tensions could still remain high, however.\\n\"Neither country\\'s threat assessments are going down. They haven\\'t changed their threat assessments. We haven\\'t changed our intentions. We haven\\'t changed our tactics,\" Daly told CNBC prior to the Xi-Blinken meeting.\\n\"These dialogues are terrific, the more of them we have, the better — but there is no sign to date that either side is really changing any of its assessments of itself of the other,\" Daly told CNBC\\'s \"Squawk Box Asia\" Monday.\\nThe State Department said Blinken emphasized that the U.S. will always stand up for Americans\\' values, and addressed China\\'s \"unfair and nonmarket economic practices and recent actions against U.S. firms.\"\\nXi maintained his stance that the U.S. must respect China and \"not harm China\\'s legitimate rights and interests,\" adding that Beijing will also respect the interests of the U.S. \"and will not challenge or replace the U.S.\"\\n\"Neither party can shape the other according to its own wishes, let alone deprive the other of its legitimate right to development,\" said Xi.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'BEIJING — Secretary of State\\xa0Antony Blinken\\xa0told NBC News on Monday that his trip to Beijing marked an \"important start\" in\\xa0stabilizing U.S. ties with China\\xa0and that the countries should move on from the\\xa0spy balloon\\xa0incident that\\xa0postponed his earlier visit.\\n\"That chapter should be closed,\" Blinken said in an interview before leaving Beijing, where he spent two days meeting with senior Chinese officials including President\\xa0Xi Jinping.\\nStopping the downward spiral in relations between the world\\'s two largest economies \"is not the product of one visit, even as intense and in some ways productive as this was,\" Blinken said. \"But it\\'s a good and I think important start.\"\\nMore from NBC News:\\nU.S. officials had played down expectations for the trip, saying any breakthroughs were unlikely. Even after Blinken\\'s visit, the two countries have yet to restore several military-to-military communication channels that China cut last year in protest of former House Speaker\\xa0Nancy Pelosi\\'s visit to Taiwan, a self-ruling democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.\\nBlinken said it was imperative for that communication to be re-established, citing recent encounters in the\\xa0Taiwan Strait\\xa0and the\\xa0South China Sea\\xa0that China says were necessary to defend its national sovereignty but the U.S. has labeled dangerous.\\n\"That\\'s the quickest path to an inadvertent conflict,\" said Blinken, who added that restoring the channels was \"not something we\\'re going to drop.\"\\nBlinken\\'s trip to China, the first by a U.S. secretary of state since 2018, was postponed in February after the discovery of an alleged Chinese spy balloon over U.S. territory.\\xa0President Joe Biden\\xa0said last month that an agreement he and Xi made to keep communications open had also been derailed by \"this silly balloon.\"\\nBlinken said the Biden administration, which\\xa0ordered the balloon shot down\\xa0by the military off the coast of South Carolina, had taken the necessary action at the time to protect U.S. interests and made its concerns clear to Beijing, which maintains it was an unmanned civilian airship that strayed off course.\"We said what we needed to say and made clear what we needed to make clear in terms of this not happening again, and so long as it doesn\\'t that chapter should be closed,\" Blinken said.\\n\"But it\\'s something we\\'re very vigilant about and that we\\'ll continue to watch,\" he added.\\nThe results of the FBI\\'s investigation into the balloon, debris from which was recovered by U.S. officials, have yet to be publicly released.\\nLast week there were concerns Blinken\\'s trip could again be postponed at the last minute after U.S. officials alleged that China had a spy station in Cuba, which both Chinese and Cuban officials denied.\\nBlinken said he had repeatedly raised the issue with his Chinese counterparts.\\n\"Of course this is not something new,\" he said. \"This is something that\\'s been going on for a number of years and something that we\\'ve been taking action on for a couple of years.\"\\nBlinken dismissed criticism that the Biden administration had played down the spying allegations and\\xa0delayed punitive economic measures against China\\xa0in order to revive the U.S.-China relationship.\\n\"We don\\'t pull any punches, and I certainly didn\\'t pull any punches with our Chinese counterparts,\" he said.\\n\"I think if you look at the actions that we\\'ve taken it\\'s hard to make that case, and in fact if you listen to our Chinese counterparts they\\'re saying exactly the opposite, complaining about many of the actions that we\\'ve taken because it\\'s necessary to advance our national interest.\"\\nCongressional Republicans had expressed opposition to Blinken\\'s trip, saying the White House needs to take a harder line with Beijing. Blinken said it would be \"totally irresponsible\" not to engage with China.\\n\"If we\\'re not engaging, it makes it that much more difficult to make sure that the competition we\\'re in doesn\\'t veer into conflict,\" he said.\\nBlinken\\'s China trip could pave the way for a phone call or in-person meeting between Biden and Xi, who first met more than a decade ago when they were both vice presidents. The two men have not spoken since meeting in person last November on the sidelines of a summit in Indonesia.\\n\"Ultimately there\\'s no substitute for the two leaders speaking directly to each other,\" Blinken said. \"That\\'s especially true in China given the power that Xi Jinping has.\"\\nJanis Mackey Frayer reported from Beijing, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong.\\n',\n",

The rapprochement was a watershed moment for diplomacy in the region.\\nBut hopes for immediate trust and consistency will likely have to wait, many regional analysts say, as the two regional powers continue to have dramatically divergent geopolitical and religious goals.\\xa0\\nA small example of that was evident on Saturday, when the Saudi foreign minister refused to hold a joint press conference in front of a portrait of the late Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who for decades directed Iran\\'s proxy wars around the Middle East. The Iranian hosts complied with the minister\\'s request for a change of venue in order to avert a diplomatic incident, regional outlets reported.\\xa0\\n\"The meeting shows us that despite minor delays, both sides are prioritizing deescalation as part of a new regional strategy aimed at tactical threat reduction,\" Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House.\\n\"Despite this progress,\" she said, \"nothing has been resolved between both capitals. What exists is a fragile agreement that can only be made stronger with time, consistency and trust building.\"\\nMichael Stephens, an associate fellow at London\\'s Royal United Services Institute, agrees.\\xa0\\n\"I think the two sides are serious, but I think this is a much longer process than maybe some of the commentariat are giving it. Not everything has changed, and there are still significant tensions to work through across a whole range of areas,\" he said, citing the war in Yemen — Tehran and Riyadh support opposing sides — as well as Iran\\'s use of proxy militias around the Middle East and attacks on Saudi infrastructure by Iran-backed groups.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIran and Saudi Arabia have long accused each other of destabilizing the region and regarded each other as a grave security threat. They\\'re often on opposite sides of regional conflicts such as those in Yemen, Lebanon and Syria. Riyadh and Washington both accuse Tehran of being behind several attacks on Saudi ships, territory and energy infrastructure in the past few years.\\nSaudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties with Iran in 2016, after Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran in response to Saudi authorities\\' execution of 47 dissidents, including a leading Shiite cleric.\\nStill, the turning of this page signals that both countries have mutual interests to pursue and realize they ultimately benefit more from diplomatic engagement.\\xa0\\n\"Both Riyadh and Tehran are motivated by economic imperatives,\" Vakil said. \"Breaking the deadlock between them could reduce missile and drone threats over the kingdom — a priority for vision 2030\\'s success while Tehran after the months of protests needs to break out of economic isolation and the stranglehold of sanctions.\"\\xa0\\nSaudi Arabia also stressed the importance of maritime security in the Gulf region, from which a huge proportion of the world\\'s oil is exported, and where skirmishes involving Iran seizing foreign ships are fairly frequent.\\xa0\\n\"I would like to refer to the importance of cooperation between the two countries on regional security, especially the security of maritime navigation ... and the importance of cooperation among all regional countries to ensure that it is free of weapons of mass destruction,\" Prince Faisal said while in Tehran.\\nDespite enduring differences and ongoing regional conflicts, the visit was \"clearly very important signaling, and it was done at the right level in terms of the right set of ministers,\" Stephens said. \"To my mind, this is exactly how the process should be building, through a series of diplomatic initiatives which show goodwill on both sides.\"\\xa0\\nPrince Farhan also met with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, and expressed hope that Raisi would accept the kingdom\\'s invitation to visit Saudi Arabia \"soon, God willing.\"\\nThe process will be slow and will likely face disturbances, but it still should enable a shift from a tense dialogue a more constructive one over time, according to regional watchers.\\n\"Broadly speaking, things will just have to be accepted as tense,\" Stephens said, adding that any changes to the U.S. administration, particularly concerning the Iran nuclear deal, could have significant ramifications and even rupture that process.\\xa0\\n\"But ultimately you make peace with enemies, you don\\'t make peace with friends,\" he said, \"so they\\'re going to have to accept that both sides look at things in a very different way.\"\\n',\n",

According to Reuters, Modi has not addressed a single press conference in India since he became prime minister in 2014, making this an extremely rare occasion.\\xa0\\nOn the defense front, officials highlighted three announcements.\\nIndia and the U.S. are expected to announce a deal to jointly produce F414 jet engines in India, involving General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics.\\nThey are also expected to announce master ship repair agreements that will lead to cost and time savings for the U.S. military — enabling U.S. navy ships to be serviced and repaired in Indian shipyards.\\nThirdly, the so-called India-U.S. Defense Acceleration Ecosystem will aim to integrate India\\'s growing private sector defense industry with the U.S. defense sector.\\nMilitary agreements between the countries will help India secure its borders with China and Pakistan and hopefully, reduce the country\\'s heavy reliance on Russia for military supplies.\\n\"India is actively engaged in diversifying away from Russian military equipment ...

So I think we fully recognize that it\\'s going to be necessary to follow through,\" one of the senior administration officials said.\\xa0\\nModi\\'s visit comes at a time when the U.S. is adopting a strategy of \"friend-shoring\" as it diversifies away from China and taps into the potential of other countries in the region.\\nOn technology, the officials said U.S. and Indian companies will be partnering to build semiconductor facilities to promote supply chain diversification.\\nThe two countries are also expected to announce agreements on strengthening critical minerals supply chains, advancing telecommunication capabilities and working on A.I. developments.\\xa0\\nOfficials said Applied Materials will also be announcing a new semiconductor center for commercialization and innovation in India.\\n\"This is India\\'s time to drive incredible growth, and we are very much looking forward to working with the prime minister and everyone in India to achieve tremendous success together,\" Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson said Wednesday in a video interview published on Modi\\'s official YouTube page.\\xa0\\n\"Many companies around the world see the trust and tremendous talent that is in India. I deeply believe this is India\\'s time to shine,\" Dickerson said.\\xa0\\nThe U.S. is also facing burgeoning competition from China in its space race.\\xa0\\nNASA and the Indian Space Research Organization will collaborate to work on a framework for human spaceflight cooperation this year.\\nIndian students are \"on pace to become the largest foreign student community in the United States with a 20% increase last year alone,\" the officials said, adding that the U.S. government wants to welcome more Indian students and workers.\\nThe U.S. issued 125,000 student visas to Indian nationals last year — or about one in every five student visas and more than what was issued to any other nationality, the U.S. Embassy in India said in June.\\n\"This year, we will interview more students than ever before,\" Brendan Mullarkey, acting minister counselor for consular affairs in India, said earlier this month.\\nThe U.S. Department of State could also make changes to the way temporary work visas are renewed, senior administration officials said ahead of Thursday\\'s joint statement.\\xa0\\n\"The people dimension should not be underestimated,\" an official said. \"When we put forward the Quad educational initiative last year, we were overwhelmed with excellent Indian candidates.\"\\n\"The diaspora community that links India with the United States is involved, enthusiastic and engaged.

       "    'content': 'Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin is a \"dead man walking\" after leading a botched rebellion against Vladimir Putin, according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group.\\nThe weekend\\'s armed revolt by Prigozhin, a former Putin ally who founded the Wagner private militia group, was widely seen as the biggest threat to the Russian president\\'s 23-year grip on power. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the episode exposed \"cracks\" in the Kremlin that were not previously seen.\\nPrigozhin is \"kind of dead man walking at this point,\" Bremmer said Monday on \"Squawk Box Asia.\" \"I would be very surprised that he\\'s still with us in a few months\\' time.\"\\nThe Prigozhin-led revolt was unprecedented new ground for Putin,\\xa0who had until then\\xa0been able to swiftly put out the occasional unarmed protest.\\xa0On the weekend,\\xa0the Wagner soldiers got within 200 kilometers (120 miles) from the capital of Moscow before their leader made the abrupt announcement to abort the mission.\\n\"Putin has imprisoned and assassinated people for far less than what Prigozhin has done to him,\" Bremmer added. \"It\\'s inconceivable to me that Putin will allow him to live any longer than is absolutely necessary.\"\\nThe Wagner fighters\\' march toward Moscow sent the Kremlin scrambling to protect the capital after the mercenaries reportedly, in a matter of hours, took control of the southwestern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don.\\nRostov is strategically symbolic as the seat of the Southern Military District for the Russian military, a logistical and command hub for Putin\\'s war on Ukraine.\\nAs part of the deal brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Prigozhin would go into exile in Belarus in exchange for calling off the insurrection. The Kremlin agreed to drop the criminal case against Prigozhin, according to the state-controlled outlet Tass.\\n\"Obviously this does show a level of unprecedented weakness for President Putin,\" Bremmer said.\\n\"But at the same time, while Putin was unprecedently tested, there was not a single high-level defection from the Russian military, from the Russian government or among the Russian oligarchs — so anyone that believes that Putin is suddenly ... on the brink of leaving power, also needs to recognize that\\'s not where we are,\" he added.\\nThe bitter feud between Prigozhin and the military establishment in Moscow escalated in recent weeks after the Kremlin wanted all private mercenary forces to sign contracts with the Defense Ministry by July 1. Prigozhin had refused.\\nThe standoff spilled into the open when Prigozhin launched an armed rebellion on Friday after accusing the Russian army of firing at his mercenaries.\\xa0\\n\"Prigozhin\\'s objective was to draw Putin\\'s attention and to impose a discussion about conditions to preserve his activities — a defined role, security, and funding,\" Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote on Twitter.\\n\"These weren\\'t demands for a governmental overthrow; they were a desperate bid to save the enterprise, hoping that Prigozhin\\'s merits in taking Bakhmut ... would be taken into account and the concerns would catch Putin\\'s serious attention,\" she added.\\nThe Wagner fighters have been a significant force in Putin\\'s war against Ukraine, and played an important role in the capture of the eastern city of Bakhmut.\\n',\n",

Prigozhin agreed to de-escalate the situation and ordered his fighters advancing on Moscow to return to their bases.\\nSpeaking alongside his counterparts from Latvia and Estonia on Tuesday, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said that the speed of the Wagner uprising underscored the strategic importance of strengthening NATO\\'s eastern flank.\\n\"I think apart from showing the reality of the political instability in Russia, they showed also an additional factor of how fast can detachments within Russia mobilize and move within its territory,\" Landsbergis said at a news conference in Paris.\\n\"Our countries\\' borders, all three of ours, are just hundreds of kilometers away from the activity, meaning that it would take for them eight to 10 hours to suddenly appear somewhere in Belarus, somewhere close to Lithuania, somewhere close to Estonian border … and that gives you an idea how we [view] this situation.\"\\nLandsbergis warned that Russia\\'s political crisis was \"creating a more volatile and more unpredictable environment\" in the Baltic region. \"Therefore, our request has always been, we need to take the defense and also the deterrence of the Baltic region very seriously.\"\\nGermany on Monday offered to send around 4,000 troops to Lithuania on a permanent basis to bolster NATO\\'s eastern flank, an announcement that has since been welcomed by lawmakers in Vilnius.\\nAhead of a NATO summit to be held in the Lithuanian capital on July 11-12, Landsbergis said Germany\\'s offer to permanently station troops in the country does not mean other areas of defense should be taken lightly.\\nStanding alongside French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, Landsbergis said the French government could be an \"invaluable partner\" in strengthening the air defense capabilities of the Baltic countries.\\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who on Monday met with Lithuanian and German troops training together in Pabrade, Lithuania, reiterated that the military alliance stands ready \"to defend every inch of Allied territory.\"\\nRussia\\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year had already fueled concerns about the regional security of the Baltic region. That\\'s because, despite being member states of both NATO and the European Union, the geographic location of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania makes them vulnerable.\\nLike Ukraine, they all share a border with Russia. Notably, Latvia and Lithuania also share a southern border with Belarus, an ally of Russia in the Kremlin\\'s war with Ukraine.\\nA jet linked to Wagner\\'s Prigozhin, a former ally of Russia\\'s longtime president and a man known as \"Putin\\'s chef,\" was reported to have arrived in Belarus from Russia on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear whether the mercenary boss was on board, however.\\nMario Bikarski and Federica Reccia, Russia and Ukraine analysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC that Prigozhin\\'s role in Belarus was unlikely to pose a direct threat to NATO members.\\n\"However, given the use of hybrid warfare techniques by Prigozhin and the Wagner group in the past – including meddling in US presidential elections – the coordination of subversive and sabotage activities from the territory of Belarus cannot be excluded,\" they said.\\nA spokesperson for the Belarusian Foreign Ministry was not immediately available to comment.\\nLatvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics described the Wagner rebellion as an example of \"one evil fighting another evil.\"\\n\"We need time to assess how this is going to impact the internal situation in Russia but also how this is going to impact regional security,\" Rinkevics said Tuesday.\\nThe minster added that Latvia\\'s government had listened \"very carefully\" to Putin\\'s defiant address on Monday evening, the Russian president\\'s first remarks since the Wagner Group\\'s attempted revolt.\\nPutin\\'s suggestion that Wagner fighters could move safely to Belarus was another regional security issue that must be taken seriously, Rinkevics said.\\nIn a separate statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for Latvia\\'s Foreign Ministry said the government was closely following internal developments within Russia.\\n\"The recent instability is an internal matter of Russia and the result of the policies and decisions of [Vladimir] Putin and his ruling elites. But it makes Russia increasingly unpredictable, and Latvia as a neighbouring country must stay vigilant,\" the spokesperson said.\\nThey added that confirmation of the presence of the Wagner Group in Belarus would constitute an additional argument to \"significantly strengthen\" sanctions against the Lukashenko regime and to reinforce the security of the EU and NATO member states bordering Belarus and Russia.\\nRussia\\'s Foreign Ministry was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC.\\nRead more of CNBC\\'s politics coverage:\\n\"The last days and week were really interesting,\" Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said Tuesday.\\n\"Be honest as well, Putin is responsible for that because he started the aggression against Ukraine,\" Tsahkna said, adding that the priority was to \"stand together\" and focus on supporting Kyiv.\\nA spokesperson for Estonia\\'s Foreign Ministry said there is no direct threat to its country and the government is exchanging information with its allies. \"Our border security has been strengthened and we urge our people not to travel to any part of Russia,\" they added.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled concerns in an interview published Thursday that Israeli-manufactured defense systems, including the U.S.-funded Iron Dome, could reach Iran if they were transferred to Ukraine.\\nIn a video interview with the Wall Street Journal, Netanyahu hinted that, if systems used by Ukrainian forces were to fall into Russian hands, the country\\'s tight relationship with fellow U.S.-sanctioned nation Iran could see them end up under Tehran\\'s control. He did not specify exactly how Iran would obtain this equipment.\\nMoscow has used Iranian-made Shahed drones in the war in Ukraine, rebranded as Geran. Tehran has in the past said it did not supply these weapons to Russia for use against Kyiv.\\n\"We\\'re concerned also with the possibility that systems that we would give to Ukraine would fall into Iranian hands and could be reverse engineered, and we would find ourselves facing Israeli systems used against Israel,\" Netanyahu told the newspaper.\\n\"That\\'s not a theoretical … threat, because Western systems, anti-tank systems for example, did exactly that journey, that we now find them on our borders with [Iran-backed group] Hezbollah.\"\\nUkraine has repeatedly emphasized its urgent need for air defense systems and ammunition to weather the aerial onslaught of the ongoing Russian offensive. U.S. senators Chris Van Hollen and Lindsey Graham have in recent days urged Israel to lift its alleged veto on the transfer of the Iron Dome air defense and missile interception system to Kyiv.\\n\\xa0\"To be clear, we are not asking Israel to transfer its own Iron Dome systems which are critical to their own security, but simply to allow the United States to transfer our own batteries to help the people of Ukraine,\" the senators said in a joint statement dated June 23.\\nIn a scathing Facebook statement, the Ukrainian embassy to Israel on June 25 said \"the current Israeli government has opted for a path of close cooperation with the russian federation,\" citing Israel\\'s diplomatic engagement with Moscow and its perceived \"near absence of Israeli humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.\"\\nIn a further statement on June 28, the Ukrainian embassy appealed to Israel, making reference to the recent Russian shelling of a restaurant in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, which left 12 dead.\\n\"The Russians are murdering our citizens - and Israel still refuses to sell defense equipment to Ukraine!\" It said. \"If israel known for its defensive capabilities, will provide Ukraine with essential protective equipment - lives will be saved.\"\\nAsked about these comments, Netanyahu said Israel is not neutral in the conflict and has stressed its sympathy and stance with Ukraine, but that it is subject to \"limitations\" and national security concerns.\\n\"My first interest, regardless of sympathy, and the steps that we take, is to ensure the security of the one and only Jewish state,\" he said.\\nIsrael\\'s stance could also be related to an unwillingness to imperil its progress to counter Tehran in neighboring Syria.\\n\"Israel\\'s reluctance to condemn Russia\\'s actions is first and foremost a strategic decision in order to avoid jeopardizing an unofficial agreement with Moscow that enables Israel to combat Iranian influence in Syria,\" the Atlantic Council pointed out in late April.\\n\"Since its military intervention began in 2015, Russia has been among the dominant forces in Syria. Russia controls the Syrian sky and generally does not restrict Israeli fighter jets from conducting strikes on Iranian proxies. With this in mind, Israel does not want to risk alienating the Kremlin.\"\\nIndeed, in the Wall Street Journal interview, Netanyahu acknowledged that \"our pilots are flying right next to Russian pilots over the skies of Syria in order to block the attempts of Iran to establish a second Hezbollah front in Syria.\"\\nIsrael has found itself increasingly isolated in its opposition to Iran, after Saudi Arabia and Tehran ended a seven-year rift through a China-brokered re-establishment of ties this March. The U.S. and Iran renewed negotiations over a prospective prisoner swap earlier this month, several sources told NBC News, amid questions about whether the two administrations would explore a potential informal deal to avert Iran\\'s accelerating nuclear program.\\nOfficial negotiations to return Washington to a variant of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear agreement with Iran – mediated by the European Union and other signatories – did not lead to a breakthrough.\\nAddressing the possibility of a fresh U.S. agreement, Netanyahu said that \"any deal with Iran that doesn\\'t set back their nuclear infrastructure, that doesn\\'t basically take it apart, is not very useful.\"\\nThe U.S. State Department and Iranian and Russian foreign ministries did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment over the possibility that systems deployed in support of Ukraine eventually come under Iranian control.\\n',\n",

It marked what many regard as the greatest challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s authority in his more than two decades in power.\\nThe short-lived rebellion was abruptly called off, however, when Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin agreed to de-escalate the situation and ordered his fighters advancing on Moscow to return to their bases.\\nThe fallout has left many observers of Russia\\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine asking what next for the Wagner Group\\'s future, both in Europe and across the globe.\\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a U.S.-based think tank, said in its latest Russia offensive campaign assessment that the Kremlin may seek to assume formal control of the Wagner Group and turn it into a state-owned enterprise, although it is not yet clear if this is the Kremlin\\'s intention.\\n\"The nationalization of Wagner would likely aid in the Russian Ministry of Defense\\'s (MoD) effort to subsume existing Wagner personnel into the regular Russian Armed Forces through contracts,\" the ISW said Thursday.\\n\"The Kremlin has not indicated that it intends to nationalize Wagner, and it is possible that Putin has yet to determine what course of action to take in subordinating the group more firmly under the Kremlin\\'s control.\"\\nPutin said Tuesday that members of the Wagner mercenary group was entirely funded and fully supplied by the state. It was the first time the long-time Russian president had publicly acknowledged the group was funded by the Kremlin.\\nThe ISW also noted recent satellite imagery collected between June 15 to June 27 appeared to show the active construction of a speculated new Wagner base in Asipovichy, Belarus. The site, the think tank said, is within 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) of a large Belarusian combine arms training ground.\\nIt adds that Wagner personnel may deploy elsewhere in Belarus, however, and \"there is nothing particularly unique\" about a potential Wagner base in Asipovichy.\\nWagner Group\\'s Prigiozhin arrived in Belarus on Tuesday shortly after agreeing to leave Russia in a deal brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Belarus is an ally of Russia in Putin\\'s war in Ukraine.\\nAnalysts told CNBC earlier this week that the fallout of the Wagner revolt could mean Russia\\'s most effective unit in Ukraine was now out of the war, potentially weakening the performance of Moscow\\'s forces on the battlefield.\\nThe Pentagon has since said, however, that the U.S. continues to see \"some elements\" of the Wagner Group in Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine.\\n\"In terms of the future of Wagner Group, that\\'s really a question best addressed by Russia, which of course … funds the Wagner Group, and how they will be employed going throughout the rest of this conflict and elsewhere around the world, since ... they also conduct operations in Africa, as well as Syria,\" Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder told reporters on Thursday.\\nAsked in a news briefing how many Wagner fighters were currently active in Ukraine following last weekend\\'s uprising, Ryder said some units of the mercenary group were still in the country but declined to provide a ballpark figure.\\n\"That\\'s something that we\\'ll continue to keep an eye on. It\\'s just too early to tell right now,\" Ryder said.\\n\"My observation in all of this analysis on what could happen next is that there is a danger of not seeing the wood for the trees,\" Christopher Granville, managing director of global political research at TS Lombard, told CNBC via telephone.\\nIt\\'s essential to remain focused on the battle in Ukraine, Granville said, noting that Putin\\'s political future is dependent on the war\\'s outcome. \"That\\'s really what it boils down to,\" he added.\\nAt best, Granville said the Wagner Group was likely to be \"a shadow of its former self\" in Ukraine following the revolt.\\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday dismissed questions about a political crisis.\\nSpeaking at a news conference, Lavrov said that Moscow always emerges stronger and more resilient from any difficulties, Reuters reported. He added that if the West had doubts about Russia\\'s stability, that was their problem.\\nElsewhere, Russian Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the deputy commander of Russian forces fighting in Ukraine, was believed to have been detained following the Wagner revolt, the Associated Press reported Thursday, citing two people familiar with the matter and Ukrainian intelligence assessments.\\nCNBC was not able to independently verify the report. It comes amid intense speculation about whether Surovikin played a role in the Wagner uprising.\\nAlexey Melnikov, the secretary of Russia\\'s Public Monitoring Committee, denied reports Surovikin was being held in Moscow\\'s Lefortovo pre-trial detention center or in any other temporary detention facility, according to state news agency TASS.\\nJames Nixey of London\\'s Chatham House think tank said in a report outlining a sustainable and just end to the Ukraine war that the potential for political instability within Russia \"should not be a deterrent to pressing home Ukraine\\'s advantage.\"\\n\"Indeed, the attempted Wagner Group mutiny … showed that domestic tumult can offer a tactical edge to Ukraine,\" Nixey said Thursday.\\nHis comments echoed the perspective of other analysts monitoring Russia\\'s war in Ukraine, with some saying Ukrainian forces can look to take advantage of confusion among Russia\\'s military leadership.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Former Vice President Mike Pence made a surprise visit to Ukraine on Thursday, becoming the first\\xa0Republican presidential candidate\\xa0to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the campaign.\\xa0\\nThe visit comes at a crucial moment in the war, just after\\xa0the Wagner mercenary group\\'s rebellion\\xa0and the\\xa0deadly Russian missile strike\\xa0on a pizza restaurant in Kramatorsk, Ukraine.\\xa0\\nPence has been\\xa0outspoken about his support\\xa0for Ukraine, and the move sends a resounding message that he believes the U.S. should play a leading role in the country\\'s fight against Russia. It also puts Pence in a unique position within the GOP — a party once dominated by hawks who advocated against growing Russian influence but is now led by a man who has repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, and whose base is largely uninterested in supporting Ukraine.\\n\"I believe America\\'s the leader of the free world,\" Pence told NBC News. \"But coming here just as a private citizen — being able to really see firsthand the heroism of the Ukrainian soldiers holding the line in those woods, see the heroism of the people here in Irpin that held back the Russian army, to see families whose homes were literally shelled in the midst of an unconscionable and unprovoked Russian invasion — just steels my resolve to do my part, to continue to call for strong American support for our Ukrainian friends and allies.\"\\nPence is spending the day getting a firsthand look at the atrocities Ukrainians have experienced over the last 16 months and visiting Moshchun, Bucha and Irpin — three cities the Russian forces occupied and ravaged — in addition to meeting with Zelenskyy.\\xa0\\nOne of Zelenskyy\\'s top advisers, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Pence \"understands absolutely clearly what Russia is.\"\\xa0\\n\"He deeply understands Russia and deeply understands the nature of this conflict, that it is not about territories, not about any businesses, not about anything except the main thing … those values for which the United States were created,\" Podolyak said, naming \"freedom, competition and democracy.\"\\n\"This is about helping a country that is willing to defend the fundamental, core values on which the United States as a whole is built,\" he added.\\xa0\\nRead more on NBC News\\nThe future of U.S. support for the Ukrainian war effort is in question, and the voters Pence is trying to woo in the Republican primary aren\\'t eager to aid the country. In the latest NBC News national poll,\\xa052% of GOP primary voters\\xa0said they would be less likely to back a candidate who supports sending more funding and weapons to Ukraine, while just 28% said they would be more likely.\\n\"I\\'m here because it\\'s important that the American people understand the progress that we\\'ve made and how support for the Ukrainian military has been in our national interest,\" Pence said when asked by NBC News about the poll results. \"I truly do believe that now, more than ever, we need leaders in our country who will articulate the importance of American leadership in the world.\"\\n\"We\\'ll let the polls and the politics take care of themselves, but for me it was important to be here to better understand what the people of Ukraine have endured, the mindless violence that was perpetrated on them in an unprovoked invasion by the Russian military and the progress that they\\'ve made in pushing back that military,\" he added. \"It\\'s steeled my resolve, and it\\'s made me better equipped to be able to go home as I speak to the American people about the vital importance of American support to repel Russian aggression.\"\\nPence\\'s stance also sets him apart from some of his Republican rivals. And when talking about his views on foreign policy Thursday, he looked back to former President Ronald Reagan as his guiding star.\\n\"Ever since the days of Ronald Reagan, the American people have always stood with those who fought back to defend their own freedom,\" he said. \"We actually called it the Reagan doctrine — the idea that if you were willing to fight the Communists back in the day in your country, we\\'ll give you the means to fight them there so that we don\\'t ever have to fight them on our soil. It\\'s part and parcel of what brought down the Soviet Union and made it possible for Ukraine to live in freedom to begin with. But I do believe that the majority of Republicans and the majority of Americans still hold to that cause of freedom.\"\\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis initially stumbled in his response to the war, getting criticism from within the party for calling it a \"territorial dispute\" and saying backing Ukraine isn\\'t a \"vital\" U.S. interest. He later changed course and called Putin a \"war criminal.\"\\xa0\\nAnd the GOP front-runner in the polls, former President Donald Trump, initially praised Putin when he invaded Ukraine, saying he was \"very savvy.\" Trump has also claimed that he would be able to end the war in\\xa0just 24 hours.\\xa0\\n\"Anyone can express their vision of how things should develop in a historical sense,\" Podolyak said, \"but we live in the real world.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko signaled he deterred his Russian counterpart and longtime ally Vladimir Putin from eliminating failed insurrectionist and Russian paramilitary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin after his attempted coup over the weekend.\\n\"I also realized that a tough decision was taken (Putin hinted at it in his address) — to eliminate those involved. I suggested that Putin should not rush to do it. I suggested that I talk to Prigozhin, his commanders,\" Lukashenko said Tuesday, in unexpectedly frank and exhaustive comments reported by Belarusian state news agency Belta.\\nLukashenko emerged as the unlikely mediator of an 11th-hour amnesty deal that agreed the withdrawal of Prigozhin\\'s Russian militia Wagner troops, who had turned weapons to march on Moscow. For his part, Putin renounced insurgency charges against Prigozhin and allowed him to retreat into exile in Belarus — a historical ally of Russia that alleges it has taken delivery of Russian tactical nuclear weapons on its territory.\\nAgainst expectations, Lukashenko on Tuesday confirmed that Prigozhin — a \"dead man walking,\" according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group — reached Belarus by private plane.\\nLukashenko described a \"completely euphoric\" Prigozhin throughout their negotiations, who \"talked using only swear words for about 30 minutes\" and made forthright demands to speak with Putin and be handed over Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and army commander Valery Gerasimov — the frequent subjects of his discontent.\\n\"No one will give you Shoigu or Gerasimov, especially in this situation,\" Lukashenko claims to have told Prigozhin. \"You know Putin as much as I do. Secondly, he will not meet with you, he will not even talk on the phone with you in this situation.\"\\nThe Belarusian leader noted the Wagner brass was \"extremely dissatisfied\" and was exercising pressure that stoked Prigozhin\\'s rebellion.\\xa0\\n\"As far as I could understand it, they strongly influenced Prigozhin himself. I had figured it out beforehand. Yes, he acts like a hero, you know, but he was under pressure and influence of those who were in command of assault units and had seen those deaths,\" Lukashenko said, alleging he nevertheless warned Prigozhin he would be \"brushed like a bug on your way.\"\\nPrigozhin\\'s turbulent relationship with the Kremlin has been fractured by assiduous accusations of incompetence among Moscow\\'s military echelons. Tensions erupted weeks ago, when the Defense Ministry mandated contracts for private military companies, which Prigozhin refused to sign.\\nRead more of CNBC\\'s politics coverage:\\nPutin initially classified Prigozhin\\'s progress against Moscow as treasonous in a televised address, but the Russian Federal Security Service has since closed the criminal case over armed mutiny charges on Tuesday.\\nCNBC could not independently verify Lukashenko\\'s account of the events. A stalwart supporter of Putin, the Belarusian head of state was reappointed in 2020 following elections that were widely contested as fraudulent.

       "    'content': 'Once a close ally and caterer to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Yevgeny Prigozhin now finds himself exiled to Belarus after leading his private mercenary group in an armed mutiny against the Russian military.\\nWithin 24 hours of a Wagner Group rebellion in which mercenaries shot down Russian fighter jets and took over the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, Prigozhin halted the militia\\'s march on Moscow in a deal that allowed him to flee the country.\\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko confirmed late on Tuesday that Prigozhin had arrived in Belarus and said other Wagner mercenaries had been offered accommodation at an abandoned naval base if they wish to join him.\\nSome analysts characterized last weekend\\'s unprecedented uprising as the most damaging moment in Putin\\'s 23 years in power and suggest this will not be the last of Prigozhin and the Wagner Group, which includes thousands of former convicts recruited from Russian jails.\\nDespite the apparent amnesty granted in exchange for halting the offensive, Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer told CNBC on Monday that Prigozhin is a \"dead man walking.\"\\nIn the absence of further details on the deal struck between Prigozhin and the Kremlin, analysts are broadly uncertain as to what the future holds for the Wagner Group and its leader.\\nThe Russian security service has said it will not prosecute the Wagner Group — but, in a televised address, Putin said that the organizers of the insurrection would be \"brought to justice,\" without mentioning Prigozhin by name.\\nAtlantic Council CEO Fred Kempe told CNBC\\'s \"The Exchange\" that this would not be a \"one-act play\" for either the Russian president or his former friend.\\n\"Will Prigozhin remain alive in Belarus? Where will he go, will he continue to command the Wagner troops, which, by the way, are filthy rich and making money off gold mines and other things across Africa and also in Syria, and who will they take their orders from? Will they take their orders from Putin, or will they take them from Prigozhin?\" Kempe mused, adding that the unknowns at this stage are the most important aspect of Prigozhin\\'s banishment.\\nThe weekend events marked the culmination of a long-running feud between Prigozhin and the Russian armed forces. Wagner\\'s presence in Ukraine was integral to the Russian war effort, but its leader became increasingly vocal in recent months about perceived incompetence among the Kremlin\\'s military top brass, blaming generals for substantial losses sustained by the mercenary group.\\nChristopher Granville, managing director of EMEA and global politics research at TS Lombard, said Prigozhin\\'s various diatribes on the Telegram messaging app over the last month, which challenged the entire premise for the war as laid out by Putin, may have \"planted a seed that will germinate in Russian society turning against the war.\"\\n\"To the extent that Prigozhin has indicated what he himself would do if he was in charge (something which this weekend\\'s events show to be his goal), his vague and contradictory statements boil down to saying that now that this mistaken war is happening, Russia must fully mobilize under new leadership to fight it to a successful conclusion,\" Granville said in a weekend note.\\n\"This stance puts Prigozhin at the hard nationalist end of the domestic political spectrum. But his critique of the war will have struck a chord with the anti-war minority in Russian society as well as with the majority core of society that is apathetically/passively loyal to the Putin system despite varying degrees of disquiet about the war.\"\\nThe extent to which Prigozhin\\'s hard-line criticism of the Russian war effort resonated will be an ongoing concern for Putin, and some analysts believe this has cleared the way for another attempt to seize control for himself, or for other warlords to fill the void.\\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul told CNBC earlier this week that the risk of the Kremlin being perceived as weak can fuel skepticism that Prigozhin\\'s quiet retirement in Belarus will play out as stated.\\n\"I\\'m not sure Putin can afford to allow this guy, who\\'s become very popular all of a sudden, to sit in Belarus and just remain quiet. I suspect that there is something more that will be done with Mr. Prigozhin,\" he said.\\nThis sentiment was echoed by British consultancy Teneo, who suggested that, despite the alleged security guarantees offered to Prigozhin, Putin \"might punish him in a highly visible way to demonstrate that such challenges to his rule will not be tolerated.\"\\n\"Looking further ahead, the chaotic turn of events in the past few days offered a glimpse into one potential scenario after Putin\\'s eventual departure from power,\" said Andrius Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe advisor at Teneo.\\n\"A fierce rivalry for power among influential interest groups, many backed by (private) military/armed power, might trigger a protracted period of political and social instability with unpredictable outcomes.\"\\nTursa also noted that some potential successors to Putin, including Prigozhin, hold \"extremely nationalist and hostile views toward the West.\"\\n\"While domestic instability could end the so-called special military operation [in Ukraine], any sustained improvement to the country\\'s business environment would be unlikely.\"\\nRead more of CNBC\\'s politics coverage:\\n',\n",

Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at Observer Research Foundation, a Delhi-based think tank.\\xa0\\n\"This is a very important visit, it is as much about India reaching out to the U.S., as it is about the U.S. reaching out to India,\" Pant said.\\nBiden has only hosted two state visits during his presidency, the first with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in December 2022, and the second with South Korea\\'s president Yoon Suk Yeol in April.\\xa0\\n\"This visit symbolizes the unwavering commitment to deepening ties and signifies the immense potential for both countries to collaborate amidst global challenges,\" Farwa Aamer the director of South Asia initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said.\\n\"For many in India and the U.S., the visit is a testament to the promise and high expectations for the future of U.S.-India collaboration — one of shared prosperity,\" Aamer said.\\xa0\\nThe U.S. is looking at India as a partner it can rely on, but its partnership will be very different since India is not an ally, Pant told CNBC.\\n\"The U.S. is not used to having partners that are not allies, but is willing to look at its partnership with India differently — one that is relatively independent minded but will help American priorities as well,\" he said in a phone interview.\\nIndia and Russia have long shared a steadfast relationship, with India relying heavily on the Kremlin for oil and military weapons.\\xa0\\nThe South Asian nation is the world\\'s largest buyer of Russian arms, accounting for approximately 20% of Russia\\'s current order, Reuters reported.\\xa0\\n\"India has been too dependent on one country and that is not good, and although dependence has dropped from 80% in the 1990s to about 65% now, dependence is still huge,\" Pant pointed out.\\xa0\\nHowever, because of the war in Ukraine, Russia has not been able to send critical defense weapons it had promised India, pushing the Indian military to look to others — such as the U.S. — for supplies.\\nStill, analysts are optimistic that the meeting between Biden and Modi could lead to more weapons agreements.\\nIndia has long been interested in buying SeaGuardian drones from the U.S., but the hoped-for deal that could be worth between $2 billion to $3 billion has been long hampered by \"bureaucratic stumbling blocks,\" Reuters reported.\\xa0\\nThe deal could still be brought back to the table.\\xa0\\n\"India\\'s Ministry of Defense has reportedly approved the purchase so it seems likely. The U.S. would like this to go through,\" Manjari Miller, senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations told CNBC.\\n\"It would be important for the partnership — only a few military allies and NATO countries have this drone, and the U.S. is particular about whom it sells U.S. weapons and technology to.\"\\xa0\\nShe highlighted that now is an important time for the deal to come through as it will draw \"India closer into the U.S. defense orbit, and is a step away from India\\'s dependence on Russian arms and equipment.\"\\xa0\\nIndia is undermining its strategic options by thinking it can continue to rely on Russia, Lisa Curtis, senior fellow and director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\\n\"It wants to try to keep a wedge between Russia and China because it doesn\\'t want to contemplate the idea of Russia and China both arrayed against it. Then you throw Pakistan in there and things look really dire from the Indian perspective,\" Curtis told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\\nThe drones will also enhance the Indian armed forces \"intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance capabilities\" that will aid the country in securing their borders with China and Pakistan, Karthik Nachiappan, research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore said.\\xa0\\nTensions between India and China over the disputed border in the Himalayan region has been ongoing since the 1950s with no end in sight. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in June 2020 in hand-to-hand combat with Chinese troops, followed by another clash in December 2022.\\nBut India wants to \"go beyond a buyer-seller relationship,\" with the U.S., Pant said adding that India is working toward a \"co-production and co-development relationship\" with the U.S. so it can build its own domestic manufacturing defense base.\\xa0\\nPrivate sectors in the U.S. could also start making more significant investments in India, with the two countries set to work together on producing fighter jet engines, said Pant.\\n\"There\\'s a change in the way the U.S. looks at India, and defense will be a beneficiary of that. India will definitely be looking to reduce its dependence on Russia, and that will be quite an extreme move,\" he added.\\xa0\\nWithout mentioning China, the White House said in May the visit will \"strengthen our two countries\\' shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our strategic technology partnership, including in defense, clean energy, and space.\"\\n\"Both the United States and India share the objective of not having an Asia that is dominated by China, or an Indo-Pacific region that is subject to Chinese coercion and assertiveness,\" said Ashley Tellis, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in a Q&A report.\\nAlthough India\\'s purchase of Russian weapons could fall, the same can\\'t be said for oil.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen Western nations imposed sanctions on Russian oil as a result of the unprovoked war in Ukraine, India doubled down on its purchases.\\xa0\\nRussian oil currently accounts for almost 20% of India\\'s annual crude imports, a significant increase from just 2% in 2021, Reuters reported.\\nOil prices were extremely volatile at the start of the Ukraine war in February last year, spiking to $100 for the first time since 2014 . But India has continued to buy cheap Russian oil since and continues trading with the country despite global sanctions on the Kremlin.\\xa0\\n\"India has become very close to the West in the last five to 10 years, but it understands that it cannot simply detach from Russia,\" Amit Ranjan, research fellow at the NUS Institute of South Asian Studies said. \\xa0\\n\"Russia is an old friend of India, and India understands the importance of the relationship … Oil is an important piece of that relationship,\" Ranjan said.\\xa0\\nPartnerships in technology will be also be top on the agenda for Modi.\\n\"I think the technology issues have become so critically important, as we see China making advancements and hear about China\\'s advancements with AI,\" according to Curtis.\\n\"In seeing how much China is advancing, the U.S. now understands the importance of really cooperating closely with India and trying to take advantage of the strengths on both sides,\" she said.\\n\"There are so many ways that the two sides can benefit from this increased technology cooperation—not to mention the progress that has been made on semiconductors. This has been a real area of focus for India and the United States, and I see that only growing as we move into the future,\" Curtis added.\\nThere will also be a flurry of business meetings with tech leaders.\\nTesla\\xa0chief Elon Musk met Modi in New York\\xa0to discuss the EV company\\'s ambitions in India and the possibility of setting up a manufacturing facilities in the country.\\nModi is also expected to meet other CEOs, including Apple\\'s Tim Cook,\\xa0Google\\'s Sundar Pichai, Microsoft\\'s Satya Nadella and\\xa0FedEx\\'s Raj Subramaniam at the White House state dinner on Thursday, sources told CNBC.\\nThe growing partnership between India and the U.S. also gives room for the two nations to adopt a \"China plus one\" strategy and push more technology companies to set up operations in India, analysts told CNBC.\\nThe U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology was announced in May last year.

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nThe Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday sued Amazon, alleging the nation\\'s dominant online retailer intentionally duped millions of consumers into signing up for its mainstay Prime program and \"sabotaged\" their attempts to cancel.\\nThe agency claims Amazon violated the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers\\' Confidence Act by using so-called dark patterns, or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice, to push consumers to enroll in Prime without their consent.\\n\"Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement.\\nAmazon spokesperson Heather Layman said in a statement that the FTC\\'s claims are \"false on the facts and the law.\"\\n\"The truth is that customers love Prime, and by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership,\" Layman said. \"As with all our products and services, we continually listen to customer feedback and look for ways to improve the customer experience, and we look forward to the facts becoming clear as this case plays out.\"\\nThe company\\'s shares closed slightly lower on Wednesday.\\nThe FTC had been investigating sign-up and cancellation processes for Amazon\\'s Prime program since March 2021. Tensions flared between Amazon and the FTC when the agency sought to have CEO Andy Jassy and founder Jeff Bezos testify on the company\\'s Prime practices. Amazon argued the request would be unduly and burdensome, which the FTC rejected.\\nLaunched in 2005, the Prime program has grown to become one of the most popular subscription services in the world, with more than 200 million members globally, and it has generated billions of dollars for Amazon. Membership costs $139 a year and includes perks like free shipping and access to streaming content.\\nThe lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, accuses Amazon leadership of slowing or rejecting changes that would have made it easier for users to cancel Prime because those changes \"adversely affected Amazon\\'s bottom line.\"\\nAmazon made it difficult for consumers to buy items on its site without Prime, and a button that instructed users to complete their transaction did not clearly state that they were also agreeing to join Prime for a recurring subscription, the complaint states.\\nThe cancellation process is also difficult to navigate and designed to deter consumers from ending their Prime subscription, the FTC alleged. Amazon used an internal term called \"Iliad\" to describe the process, referencing Homer\\'s epic poem about the Trojan War, the agency said, citing a report by Insider.\\nThe complaint marks the third case the FTC has brought against Amazon in the last month. Amazon in late May agreed to pay the agency more than $30 million to settle cases alleging privacy lapses in its Alexa and Ring units. The company said it disagreed with the FTC\\'s claims but that it settled in order to move on from the matter.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Generative artificial intelligence, the technology that viral chatbot ChatGPT is based on, could be the new battleground in the battle for tech supremacy between the U.S. and China, according to one analyst.\\nDespite the two nations seeking better relations after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, analysts said the tech tensions will continue.\\nWashington has sought to cut off China from key technology like semiconductors while China has looked to boost its self-sufficiency and wean itself off American technology, touting its domestic sectors.\\n\"The status quo isn\\'t likely to change much on any front — from sanctions to business pressure,\" Abishur Prakash, CEO of Toronto-based advisory firm, The Geopolitical Business, told CNBC via email.\\nAI, which is seen as a critical technology by both nations, will likely be dragged into the battle between the two sides.\\nFormer President Donald Trump began a trade war with China and technology was dragged in the middle Washington\\'s tactics so far have relied on restricting China\\'s access to technologies it deems critical such as semiconductors.\\nAn escalation occurred last year when the U.S. introduced sweeping rules aimed at cutting China off from major tools and components to make advanced chips and choking the country off from critical semiconductors. The move was seen as potentially hobbling China\\'s homegrown chip industry. U.S. has also got allies to align on tough export rules of tech to China.\\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has looked to boost its own domestic technology including semiconductors, with funding such as the $52 billion available via the Chips and Science Act.\\nWashington\\'s attention is now likely to turn to generative AI.\\n\"There will likely be more attempts coming from Washington to target the development in China of some types of applications, and generative AI could be in the crosshairs in the coming year,\"  Paul Triolo, the technology policy lead at consulting firm\\xa0Albright\\xa0Stonebridge, told\\xa0CNBC.\\nIt comes \"as the Biden administration determines which technologies could benefit both China\\'s military modernization, and which could also boost Chinese companies\\' ability to make breakthroughs in generative AI,\" he added.  \\nGenerative AI relates to applications such as ChatGPT which are able to generate content when prompted by users.\\nAI needs to be trained on huge amounts of data in order to work. Generative AI is based on so-called large language models, meaning it is trained on huge amount of language in order to be able to understand and respond to prompts from users.\\nThe processing of this data requires a large amount of computing power that is powered by specific semiconductors, such as those sold by U.S. firm Nvidia, which is seen as the market leader in such chips.\\nPart of the U.S.\\'s current restrictions aim to cut China off from some of Nvidia\\'s key chips, which in turn could hamper China\\'s AI development.\\nBernstein says buy this China-based personal finance stock that can rally nearly 60%\\nMorgan Stanley names 2 chip stocks with \\'significant upside\\' as China bans Micron\\nThis fund puts a spin on emerging markets investing with bets from Nvidia to Chinese spirits\\nWashington is also carrying out an outbound investment review, which would put rules in place for American investment into foreign companies.\\n\"The upcoming outbound investment review executive order will include restrictions on U.S. investment in some AI-related technologies, and this will be a major indication of the direction of U.S. technology controls in the final two years of the Biden administration,\" Triolo said.\\nChatGPT, developed by American firm OpenAI, has taken the world by storm and has sparked somewhat of an AI arms race between U.S. technology companies including Microsoft, which is an investor, and Alphabet.\\nChinese technology giants have taken note.\\nOver the past few months, Chinese technology giants from Baidu to Alibaba have announced plans and launched trials for their own ChatGPT rivals.\\nChina sees AI development as a strategic priority. Chinese regulators have brought in regulations around certain aspects of AI development, so the technology adheres to Beijing\\'s strict internet rules, but the government is still keen to boost the domestic industry.\\nEven as the U.S. looks to restrict China\\'s access to key AI chips, Alibaba and Baidu have been designing their own semiconductors. While there hasn\\'t been any impact on these chips from U.S. sanctions so far, it is an area that the government and tech firms will be watching closely.\\nBeijing has accused the U.S. of violating international trade rules through its sanctions and said curbs on China\\'s chip industry amount to \"bullying.\"\\nWashington maintains its moves are in the interest of national security and are targeting specific sensitive technologies.\\nChina hasn\\'t retaliated much. However, last month Chinese regulators barred operators of \"critical information infrastructure\" from buying chips from U.S. firm Micron, claiming the company\\'s products failed its network security review.\\nTechnology wasn\\'t spoken about in public too much when Blinken recently met with China\\'s Xi, but the two sides no doubt discussed it.\\nTriolo told\\xa0CNBC that the U.S. likely raised issues about the treatment of Micron while China would have brought up the export controls.\\n\"Beijing views that package [export controls], and the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, as a one-two punch designed to decouple China\\'s semiconductor industry from the global semiconductor ecosystem,\" Triolo said.\\nHowever, the two sides are in somewhat of a stalemate.\\nBlinken spoke about areas of co-operation between the U.S. and China such as the climate crisis and the economy. But advanced technology is one area the two nations remain in competition.\\n\"But, at the same time, as I said, it\\'s not in our interest to provide technology to China that could be used against us,\" Blinken said on Monday.\\n\"What China wants, the U.S. isn\\'t going to give, like opening up the chip ecosystem to Beijing or not scrutinizing Chinese investment in U.S. technology,\" Prakash said. \"The U.S.-China battle for technology supremacy is about to enter its primetime.\"\\nUnlike the previous flashpoints, like over 5G or TikTok, when both sides still believed differences could be patched over, now such ideas are politically dead. The chasm between the U.S. and China has expanded so much — and neither superpower wants to bridge the differences.\"\\n',\n",

The voices are trained on voices from professional human voice actors.\\xa0\\nIn a demonstration of the tech on a call with CNBC, Voicemod\\'s CEO, Jaime Bosch, showed himself speaking regularly and changing it to several different voices, from a high-pitched female speaker to a baritone male voice.\\nGamers can download the app on their Apple Mac or Windows PC and incorporate Voicemod\\'s technology as a \"virtual microphone\" that sits in between the microphone application they\\'re using to start speaking through the alternative personas.\\xa0\\nVoicemod, which counts talent from leading technical universities in Valencia and Barcelona, has been working on voice synthesis and interactive audio features since 2014, with many of its employees specializing in music technology and audio.\\xa0\\nUsed by more than 40 million people, Voicemod\\'s tech can be used by people in the social app Discord to speak with each other in voices other than their own while playing games.\\xa0\\n\"We have an amazing creativity community using this mainly to have fun, enjoy it with their friends and have a sense of belonging,\" Bosch said in an interview with CNBC.\\n\"One of the biggest use cases I love the most is shy people — we have some people who write to us saying I wasn\\'t able to really socialize with people who are now able to do that.\"\\nIt\\'s a milestone in the world of conversational AI.

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nBitcoin has rallied sharply this month — but not for reasons you might think.\\nThe world\\'s largest digital currency has risen more than 12% since the beginning of June. On Wednesday, its price topped $30,000 to hit its highest level since April 14, according to Coin Metrics data.\\nMarket players have attributed the jump to the news that U.S. asset management giant BlackRock had filed for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund tracking the market price of the underlying asset.\\nWhile that may be part of the reason, the outsized moved can be put down to another factor beyond the news flow surrounding large institutions taking steps to embrace bitcoin or other digital assets.\\nCrypto \"market depth\" has been sitting at very low levels this year. Market depth refers to a market\\'s ability to absorb relatively large buy and sell orders. When market depth is low and big players put in orders to buy or sell digital coins, prices can move in a big way up or down, even if the orders are not that huge.\\nMarket depth is a measure of liquidity in a market.\\nAccording to data firm Kaiko, bitcoin\\'s market depth has fallen 20% since the start of this year. Bitcoin has been one of the hardest-hit cryptocurrencies in terms of market depth, Kaiko said.\\n\"Bitcoin\\'s recent surge in value has largely been driven by large trades within a less liquid market,\" Jamie Sly, head of research at CCData, told CNBC via email.\\n\"Our analysis of market orders over 5 BTC reveals an aggressive surge in market buying, suggesting large players are seeking to gain exposure to digital assets.\"\\n\"When combining large orders with thin books, the market is subject to more volatile movements,\" Sly added.\\nThat lack of liquidity has in part been driven by the regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry from U.S. authorities. The Securities and Exchange Commission has sued major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.\\nLow liquidity, which has been a feature of the crypto market all year, is also partly behind bitcoin\\'s 80% year-to-date rally.\\nAnother notable feature of the current crypto market is the low volumes being traded on exchanges.\\nDaily trading volume in the cryptocurrency currently sits at around $24 billion, according to crypto data website CoinGecko.\\nThat\\'s down markedly from the more than $100 billion of overall trading volume in bitcoin during the peak of the 2021 crypto rally, when bitcoin rose close to an all-time high of nearly $69,000.\\nLarge crypto investors usually hope that an early surge in prices will be enough to tempt retail investors back into participating in the rally which ultimately boosts prices for bitcoin and other digital coins. But that hasn\\'t happened.\\n\"What is notable about this rally is that trade volumes overall are at multi-year lows, and we are only seeing a slight increase, which even then is far lower than levels we saw from January to March,\" Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, told CNBC.\\n\"I think trading volumes and price volatility are two of the most telling indicators of crypto market activity. Both volatility and volumes are at multi-year lows, and even a rapid increase in price is not enough to draw traders in.\"\\nIn the last bitcoin cycle, market momentum was largely driven by big, institutional names as investment banks from Morgan Stanley to Goldman Sachs set up trading desks to give their clients exposure to the digital currency.\\nHowever, the market really started to break out only when retail traders started to take notice — in early 2021, people became tempted by the phenomenon that was NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and other more speculative bets.\\nLater that year, the cryptocurrency market experienced a seismic rally, with the price of bitcoin zooming to unprecedented levels. That was in tandem with surging trading volume, which climbed from $21.2 billion at the start of 2020 to $105.4 billion on Nov. 9, 2021, when bitcoin hits its all-time high, according to CoinGecko.\\nToday, trading volume is nowhere near where it was at the height of the 2021 crypto boom.\\n\"Any bit of news, if it\\'s good, then the professional traders trade — otherwise, they\\'re not trading,\" Carol Alexander, a professor of finance at the University of Sussex, told CNBC.\\n\"If a bit of good news like the bitcoin ETF comes, they fire the cannons upwards.\"\\nBlackRock\\'s ETF filing was followed by similar move from Invesco and WisdomTree, which also filed for their own respective bitcoin-related products.\\n\"Bitcoin and ether are both being manipulated in this way by the professional traders. They don\\'t trade most of the time, they wait until there\\'s a bit of good news,\" Alexander said.\\n\"Then they\\'ll sell the top and you\\'ve got a sideways market.\"\\nIndeed, bitcoin has traded within a range this year, and attempts to burst significantly higher have been thwarted.\\nAlexander thinks bitcoin is likely to trade within a range of between $25,000 and $30,000 for the remainder of the summer.\\nShe expects, however, that toward the end of the year, the cryptocurrency will climb toward $50,000, citing attempts from larger market players to prop up the market, with big purchases making outsized moves.\\n\"It\\'s not a market for ordinary clients. It\\'s really is not,\" she warned.\\nVijay Ayyar, vice president of international markets at the Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX, told CNBC he suspects the latest run-up in bitcoin\\'s price is being driven more by \"long term institutional buyers.\"\\nBig funds and crypto-focused hedge funds are among the market participants driving the action, Ayyar added.\\n\"I don\\'t think this is as much of a retail push, since retail was quite flushed out during the recent pullback,\" he said.\\nSeveral crypto industry insiders have expressed hopes that the market is nearing a \"bottoming\" period where it can start to rise again.\\nThe recent price action echoes activity in 2018, when both bitcoin\\'s price and volumes were subdued for several months before beginning to rise again the following year.\\nHowever, CCData\\'s Sly said it is \"still too early to say whether the worst is over for bitcoin.\"\\n\"The recent wave of interest from traditional financial institutions, like Blackrock, Citadel, and Fidelity instils a renewed optimism in the market,\" he said.\\n\"Provided the wider macro environment and equity markets continue to be favorable, it is possible that bitcoin could maintain its current positive price trajectory.\"\\nWATCH: Can ethereum topple bitcoin as the crypto king?\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nGoogle users have long been able to append their search queries with the term \"Reddit\" to find helpful resources on specific topics.\\nWhen thousands of Reddit forums went dark earlier this month, that tactic lost its effectiveness. Many pages in search results were suddenly inaccessible or unhelpful, because moderators of some of the most popular forums turned their pages to private as part of a widespread protest of Reddit\\'s decision to start charging developers for access to its data.\\nIt\\'s an issue that Google executives say is at least partially resolved by a new feature called Perspectives that was unveiled Monday. The Perspectives tab, available now on mobile web and the Google app in the U.S., promises to surface discussion forums and videos from social media platforms like TikTok, YouTube, Reddit and Quora.\\nAt an all-hands meeting earlier this month, Prabhakar Raghavan, Google\\'s senior vice president in charge of search, told employees that the company was working on ways for search to display helpful resources in results without requiring users to add \"Reddit\" to their searches. Raghavan acknowledged that users had grown frustrated with the experience.\\n\"Many of you may wonder how we have a search team that\\'s iterating and building all this new stuff and yet somehow, users are still not quite happy,\" Raghavan said. \"We need to make users happy.\"\\nRaghavan was responding to an employee comment about negative user feedback because of too many ads and irrelevant results. \"What can we do to improve the user experience on the core product that made Google a household name?\" the employee asked, according to audio of the meeting obtained by CNBC.\\nGoogle is in the process of trying to revamp search to keep pace with rivals in taking advantage of the latest advances in generative artificial intelligence, which involves providing more sophisticated and conversational answers to text-based queries.\\nAt its annual developer conference in May, the company said it was experimenting with an effort called Search Generative Experience, which still isn\\'t available to everyone, showing more in-depth results powered by generative AI.\\xa0Google also launched a ChatGPT competitor called Bard earlier this year. Bard remains separate from search and is still in experimental mode.\\nAnother employee question in the companywide meeting asked if Google can more easily surface \"authentic discussion\" since the \"Reddit blackout\" was making it harder to find such content.\\nCEO Sundar Pichai chimed in to to say that users don\\'t want \"blue links\" as much as they want \"more comprehensive answers.\" That\\'s why they add the name of forum sites like Reddit to their searches, he said.\\nHJ Kim, vice president of engineering in search, said at the meeting that users have been asking for more content from sites like Reddit. He said the Perspectives tab is one feature the company has been working on in response, but that it can do a better job.\\n\"Over the last couple of years, search overall has developed these large, cross-functional teams to go after this kind of content,\" Kim said, referring to Reddit. \"We could do a better job. We realize that. And over the last couple of years, we\\'ve actually developed quite a bit.\"\\nRaghavan said that Google would determine what\\'s \"getting the best traction.\"\\n\"But the idea there is for these questions, where there are multiple opinions, instead of appending stuff, you actually go in there and get the answer right away and we\\'re actually seeing good early engagement on that,\" Raghavan said.\\nHe added that while the company is spending a lot of time in AI, it\\'s not the only answer to the problem.\\n\"Generative AI is one aspect but it won\\'t fully solve this issue — I want to be clear,\" he said. \"We actually have teams that are running experiments,\" with Perspectives as one example.\\n\"We have to keep up and do a better job of addressing these new and emerging needs,\" he said.\\nLara Levin, a Google spokeswoman, told CNBC in a statement that search \"satisfies the overwhelming majority of user needs, and we\\'re always improving Search to meet the evolving needs of every one of our users.\"\\n\"Features like the Perspectives filter are part of how we\\'re making sure people continue to find the most helpful info on Google from a wide range of sources and formats,\" Levin said.\\nWATCH: OpenAI CEO is on a world tour, trying to stay ahead of global regulators\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nGoogle is distancing itself from a drag performance it planned as the closing event for Pride month after a group of employees circulated an internal petition opposing it, claiming religious discrimination.\\nEach year, Google sponsors a series of Pride events in San Francisco and other locations for employees and the public. This year, the closing event was a \"Pride and Drag Show\" featuring popular performer \"Peaches Christ,\" who was scheduled to perform Tuesday at LGBTQ+ bar Beaux in San Francisco to \"wrap up this amazing month,\" according to a now-removed internal description of the event viewed by CNBC.\\nHowever, employees noticed the company removed the show from the internal company events page at around the same time a petition began circulating opposing the event, according to internal discussions viewed by CNBC.\\nA few hundred employees signed the petition opposing the drag performance, claiming it sexualizes and disrespects Christian co-workers, and accused Google of religious discrimination, according to the petition viewed by CNBC. \"Their provocative and inflammatory artistry is considered a direct affront to the religion beliefs and sensitivities of Christians,\" the petition stated, referring to the drag performer.\\nGoogle confirmed to CNBC that it no longer categorized the performance as a Google-recognized diversity, equity and inclusion event. The company set up a separate social gathering at Google offices that it is now encouraging employees to attend instead.\\nAn internal team planned the closing drag event \"without going through our standard events process,\" said spokesperson Chris Pappas in a statement to CNBC. \"While the event organizers have shifted the official team event onsite, the performance will go on at the planned venue — and it\\'s open to the public, so employees can still attend.\"\\nPappas added, \"We\\'ve long been very proud to celebrate and support the LGBTQ+ community. Our Pride celebrations have regularly featured drag artists for many years, including several this year.\"\\nThe company did not address whether the employee petition played a part in the decision to change its closing event.\\nThe petition states that organizers complained to People Operations, Google\\'s human resources department, and claimed the venue violates one of Google\\'s event guidelines, which bans sexuality explicit activity. The petition also demands an apology from organizers and promoters of the event.\\nSome employees criticized the petition, saying the complaints were subjective and feed into political culture wars, according to internal discussions viewed by CNBC.\\xa0Drag shows have been a target of religious and conservative organizations and politicians leading up to the 2024 presidential election. That includes a flurry of legislative proposals backed by GOP governors taking aim at drag events.\\xa0\\nEmployees also criticized Google leadership for what they viewed as the quiet removal of the event from the internal website and a buckling to petitioners\\' pressure. A company spokesperson said changes to the event were communicated to a team employee resource group last week.\\nSan Francisco venues host Pride events every June, which is recognized as Pride month, and those events commonly include drag shows of various stage acts. Google is one of many corporate sponsors of various Pride events that also include fireside chats with influential figures and community documentary screenings for the public and employees.\\nThe company\\'s Pride website features several affirmations supporting the LGBTQ+ community with statements such as \"A Space to Belong,\" writing that \"a global shutdown reaffirmed our universal need for the inclusive spaces that bring us together and celebrate belonging.\"\\n',\n",

She will hand the reins to Starling\\'s chief operating officer, John Mountain, who has been with the bank since 2015.\\n\"I have spent nearly a decade here as both the founder and CEO, a dual role which is unique in U.K. banking,\" Boden said in a statement Thursday. \"It\\'s been all-consuming and I\\'ve loved every minute of it.\"\\n\"Now that we have grown from being an aspiring challenger to an established bank, it is clear the roles and priorities of a CEO and a large shareholder ultimately differ and require distinct approaches. As Starling continues to evolve and grow, separating my two roles is in the bank\\'s best interests.\"\\nStarling reported annual revenue of £453 million ($600 million) for the year to March 31, 2023, more than doubling from 2022, with pre-tax profits of £195 million, a sixfold increase year over year.\\nTotal lending stood at £4.9 billion, up from £3.3 billion. Customer deposits increased 17% to £10.6 billion.\\nBoden, who co-founded Starling in 2014, took the startup from a tiny challenger in banking to a major player in the U.K.\\'s financial scene.\\nThe often outspoken CEO has been a key voice behind the U.K. government\\'s attempt to make it an established fintech hub.\\nShe is also a staunch critic of social media\\'s role in online fraud as well as a prominent crypto skeptic.\\nOn a call with reporters Thursday, Boden said the main thing that triggered her decision was concerns that her significant shareholding in the firm could create a conflict of interest.\\nBoden owns a 4% stake in Starling. \\nShe added that it was herself, not the company\\'s board, that initiated conversations about her departure.\\nStarling has raised a total of £946.5 billion to date from investors including Goldman Sachs, Fidelity and the Qatar Investment Authority. The bank was last valued at £2.5 billion.\\nIn response to a CNBC question Thursday, Boden said that, were the firm to raise capital today, its shares would not decrease in value from their last price.\\nAsked how her plans to step down may impact Starling\\'s path toward an initial public offering, Boden said the IPO market is currently closed and the firm is in no immediate hurry.\\nThe U.K. has received plenty of criticism from top tech bosses over its tech listings environment — earlier this year, the CEO of Revolut said he would never list in London.\\nBoden said that Starling has not yet taken a decision on a listing venue for its eventual public offering, however the U.K. was likely to be the place in which it debuts.\\n\"We need to keep our options open. This is not the right time to make a decision on listing venue, however we\\'re a U.K. bank and a very successful U.K. bank,\" Boden said.\\n\"Customers love us and the default situation would be a U.K. listing because of the consumer enthusiasm for a brand that is as powerful as Starling.\"\\n',\n",

ChatGPT, which uses massive language models to create human-sounding responses to questions, has ignited an arms race among tech giants and chipmakers over what is seen as the next foundational innovation.\\nThe technology has a range of possible uses in finance. Banks including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have already begun testing it for internal use. That includes ways to help Goldman engineers create code or answer Morgan Stanley financial advisors\\' queries.\\nBut JPMorgan may be the first financial incumbent aiming to release a GPT-like product directly to its customers, according to Washington D.C.-based trademark attorney Josh Gerben.\\n\"This is a real indication they might have a potential product to launch in the near future,\" Gerben said.\\n\"Companies like JPMorgan don\\'t just file trademarks for the fun of it,\" he said. The filing includes \"a sworn statement from a corporate officer essentially saying, \\'Yes, we plan on using this trademark.\\'\"\\nJPMorgan must launch IndexGPT within about three years of approval to secure the trademark, according to the lawyer. Trademarks typically take nearly a year to be approved, thanks to backlogs at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, he said.\\nThe applications are typically vaguely written to give companies the broadest possible protections, Gerben said.\\nBut JPMorgan\\'s filing does specify that IndexGPT uses the same flavor of A.I. popularized by ChatGPT; the bank plans to use A.I. powered by \"Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models.\"\\n\"It\\'s an A.I. program to select financial securities,\" Gerben said. \"This sounds to me like they\\'re trying to put my financial advisor out of business.\"\\nJPMorgan declined to comment for this article.\\nFinancial advisors have long feared the arrival of technology good enough to displace their role in markets. Those fears have largely yet to materialize.\\nWealth management firms, including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America\\'s Merrill, offer simple roboadvisor services, but that hasn\\'t stopped their human advisors from gathering billions of dollars more in assets.\\nEarlier this week, executives at JPMorgan touted their progress in applying A.I. across operations at the company\\'s annual investor conference.\\nThe bank, which employs 1,500 data scientists and machine-learning engineers, is testing \"a number of use cases\" for GPT technology, said global tech chief Lori Beer.\\n\"We couldn\\'t discuss A.I. without mentioning GPT and large language models,\" Beer said. \"We\\'ve recognized the power and opportunity of these tools and are committed to exploring all the ways they can deliver value for the firm.\"\\n',\n",

The ratings agency at the time said this reflected Klarna\\'s \"ability to defend its robust e-commerce position in its key markets, rebuild profitability,\" and \"maintain a strong capital buffer.\"\\nEarly indications signal that Klarna\\'s deep cost-cutting measures are starting to pay off. The company went on a hiring spree during 2020 and 2021 to capitalize on growth triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, and was forced to reduce headcount by roughly 10% in May 2022 in response to investor pressure to slim down operations. Despite this measure, it still later lost 85% of its market value in a funding round last summer.\\nKlarna is not alone in its troubles. Buy now, pay later firms, which allow shoppers to defer payments to a later date or pay over installments, have been particularly impacted by souring investor sentiment on technology, amid a worsening macroeconomic environment.\\nMore recently, Klarna has turned its focus toward AI. The company revamped its app with a more advanced AI recommendation algorithm to help its merchants target customers more effectively.\\nKlarna previously launched the ability to integrate OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT into its service with a plugin that lets users ask the popular AI chatbot for shopping inspiration. The company said it was embedding AI in its business to \"improve internal efficiencies and provide customers with an even better service and experience,\" for example through real-time translations in customer chat.\\nThe company has now also made a foray into facilitating short-term holiday rentals.  Earlier this month, Klarna announced a partnership with Airbnb to let the online vacation rental firm\\'s customers book holidays and pay down the cost over installments.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'LONDON — British digital bank Zopa is beefing up its management team with a couple of senior hires, as the company looks to fuel growth and prepare its business for an eventual public listing.\\nThe SoftBank-backed company, which offers credit cards, personal loans and savings accounts, told CNBC exclusively it has hired Peter Donlon, the former chief technology officer of online card retailer Moonpig, as its CTO.\\nThe firm has also brought in Kate Erb, a qualified chartered accountant from KPMG with over 20 years of experience in financial services, as its chief operating officer.\\nErb was most recently an operations director at Leeds Building Society.\\nDonlon notably saw Moonpig through its public listing in 2021, which valued the company at around £1.2 billion at the time. Moonpig now trades at a price of £151 per share, which gives it a market capitalization of £518 million, reflecting a broad slump in technology shares.\\nHis appointment reflects a push from Zopa to grow in maturity and ramp up user growth in anticipation of an eventual initial public offering (IPO). Zopa had planned to go public last year, however it put this ambition on ice as the stock market took a turn for the worst with rising interest rates clobbering high-growth tech stocks.\\nCEO Jaidev Janardana insisted the bank has no plans for an IPO in the immediate term, however he suggested a flotation could be on the horizon by mid-next year were sentiment in the public markets to change.\\nWhat will need to change for that to happen, he explained, is for the public markets to open back up.\\n\"We haven\\'t had great IPOs,\" he told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of London Tech Week this week. \"I would love to see some successful IPOs actually coming.\"\\n\"If you look at kind of banks, and how they\\'re valued, or tech companies, both of them, public market valuations are not great.\"\\n\"The second thing is ... liquidity.\" he added. \"We need to make sure that there is enough liquidity for a public company to be truly public. Shares should be able to be bought and sold reasonably easily.\"\\nZopa will soon reach 1 million customers, a spokesman for the company told CNBC. It ultimately wants to hit 5 million users in the coming years. The firm competes with large banks as well as fintechs like Monzo, Revolut and Starling.\\nJanardana suggested the company could look to ramp up growth of its business through mergers and acquisitions, and a move into other areas of finance including small business loans and open banking, which allows for the sharing of data between banks and third-party firms.\\nZopa raised £75 million ($95.9 million) from investors earlier this year.\\n\"We are open,\" he said. \"Where there is opportunity for us to use open banking, infrastructure, data, to be able to provide holistic experiences to customers is something that has been of interest for us.\"\\n\"SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) lending is another thing that is of interest for us.\"\\nZopa reached profitability on a monthly basis in April 2022. Zopa aims to achieve full-year profitability by the end of 2023.\\nIn terms of the products that Janardana isn\\'t interested in rolling out, crypto tops the list. The financial executive, who has helmed Zopa since 2014, said that crypto \"is not great for the retail consumer today.\"\\n\"I\\'m not a big fan of crypto yet, I\\'m not convinced,\" he said. \"It\\'s a complicated product that people don\\'t understand, which is why we never offered it.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'LONDON — Zepz, the owner of money transfer firms WorldRemit and Sendwave, is on the hunt for mergers and acquisitions after cutting 26% of its workforce last month, the company\\'s CEO told CNBC.\\nWith a $5 billion valuation, Zepz is one of the largest fintech companies in Europe, backed by leading investors including Accel, TCV and Leapfrog.\\nThe company enables users to send money from a smartphone or computer to people abroad, who can receive it in their bank account, mobile wallet, or as a mobile airtime top-up.\\nThe service is a challenger to large banks and established money transfer services like Western Union, touting cheaper fees and the ability to move funds rapidly. A close rival is Wise, which also claims to offer cheaper international money transfers than banks.\\nMark Lenhard, Zepz\\'s CEO, said the firm wanted to grow its portfolio of businesses in an effort to own a larger part of the global digital payments pie.\\nLenhard didn\\'t identify which companies Zepz was looking to buy, but said the sharp slump in private fintech valuations made it an attractive time to kick off M&A exploration.\\nThe overall value of cross-border payments is forecast to increase from $150 trillion in 2017 to over $250 trillion by 2027, according to the Bank of England. It\\'s a highly competitive industry with various players operating and taking a slice of each transaction a consumer makes.\\nA particular focus for Zepz product-wise in the near term is digital wallets, Lenhard said, with the company planning to launch its first digital wallet \"imminently.\"\\n\"We want to be a core financial hub for a very particular segment,\" he told CNBC Wednesday, with a particular focus on migrant communities sending funds home.\\nThe push into M&A is a surprise move in many ways as it follows a significant amount of cost reduction at the 13-year-old company. In May, Zepz laid off 420 employees, equating to about 26% of its global workforce.\\nZepz says it cut the jobs to consolidate its operations after its acqusition of U.S. remittances firm Sendwave led to a duplication of certain roles.\\nStill, at the time, Zepz said it wasn\\'t pausing hiring, and was actively trying to fill 200 roles.\\nIt marked the second time in just under a year Zepz laid off staff. In June 2022, Zepz cut around 5% of its workforce, according to Sky News.\\n\"Any time you\\'re laying off individuals it\\'s hard, it sucks, but it was certainly the right thing to do. We\\'ve expanded things out of that,\" Lenhard said Wednesday.\\nHe added that he hopes the company\\'s upcoming digital wallet product will convince customers to rely more on Zepz, rather than using competing digital banks and other financial apps which have grown their services to offer a much wider range of products.\\nPayPal, for example, offers users mobile wallets, the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies, and buy now, pay later installment loans, among other things.\\nLike other fintechs, Zepz has been in cost-cutting mode as the industry faces huge pressure from a slump in technology valuations, stoked by a host of macroeconomic headwinds including higher inflation and interest rates.\\nDespite this, Zepz says it has been less susceptible to those economic pressures than other firms in the space. World remittances is less impacted by broader macroeconomic pressures than, say, banking, according to Lenhard.\\nZepz\\'s overall customer transactions are up 25% year-to-date as of April 2023, the company said, while its customer growth accelerated to 30% on average and by as much as 80% in certain areas.\\nThe company, which hit monthly profitability in the first half of 2022, wants to achieve profitability on a full-year basis this year.\\nWATCH: \\'Sea of sameness\\': Are smartphone makers out of ideas?\\n',\n",

But just 18 months after the bank\\'s September 2021 release announcing the deal, Solomon said he was selling the business after mounting losses and dysfunction in Goldman\\'s consumer division forced a strategic shift.\\nKKR, Apollo Global Management, Sixth Street Partners, Warburg Pincus and Synchrony Bank were among the asset managers and lenders involved in the first round of bids, which began in early June, according to the people, who declined to be identified speaking about the sale.\\n\"Everybody\\'s been coming in low, and the Goldman team keeps pushing back, pounding the table about the value of it,\" said one of the bidders.\\nThe bank is continuing negotiations with a smaller group of bidders this week with the hope of ratcheting up the ultimate price, according to the sources.\\nGoldman has been pursuing offers for GreenSky\\'s loan origination business and its book of existing loans separately as well as offers for a single deal, according to the people familiar.\\nOne bidder said the origination platform is worth roughly $300 million, while another said it was worth closer to $500 million.\\nIf a deal closed at anywhere near that valuation, it would represent a steep discount to what Goldman paid for it, forcing the company to disclose a write-down hitting its bottom line in an upcoming quarter.\\nWhile the all-stock acquisition was announced with a $2.24 billion valuation, it was worth closer to $1.7 billion by the time the transaction closed six months later, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.\\nKKR, Synchrony and other bidders declined to comment for this article. Some of the bidders had been named earlier by Semafor.\\nGoldman President John Waldron acknowledged the potential for \"some noise\" to the bank\\'s results as a result of the GreenSky sale. The transaction could wipe out $500 million in goodwill tied to buying the lender, and the sale of loans could trigger other one-time accounting hits, he told analysts at a June 1 conference.\\nThe turbulence marks the latest fallout from Solomon\\'s decision to exit most of the bank\\'s consumer efforts after pushing hard for his vision to transform Goldman into a fintech disruptor.\\n\"We\\'re pleased with the participation by bidders,\" Goldman spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement. \"We\\'re in the middle of the process and we\\'ll learn more as we go forward.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'There are two broad categories of life insurance, and data suggests many households aren\\'t buying the most cost-effective one.\\nAmericans bought 4.1 million term insurance policies in 2021, accounting for 40% of all individual policies purchased that year, according to the most recent data from the American Council of Life Insurers. About 6.3 million policies, or 60%, were permanent life insurance.\\nBut this doesn\\'t seem to jibe with financial advisors\\' general recommendation.\\n\"Most people just need term insurance,\" said Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner based in Jacksonville, Florida, and a member of CNBC\\'s Advisor Council.\\nMore from Personal Finance:How many credit cards should you have? The answer isn\\'t zeroAmericans think they will need nearly $1.3 million to retireRepublicans, Democrats divided on Social Security reform\\nLife insurance is a form of financial protection that pays money to beneficiaries, such as kids or a spouse, if a policyholder dies.\\nTerm insurance only pays out a death benefit during a specified term, perhaps 10, 20 or 30 years. Unless renewed, the coverage lapses after that time.\\nBy contrast, permanent insurance policies — such as whole life and universal life — offer continuous coverage until the policyholder dies. They\\'re also known as cash value policies since they have interest-bearing accounts.\\nPermanent insurance is generally more costly, advisors said. Policy premiums are spread over a longer time, and those payments are used to cover insurance costs and build up cash value.\\n\"Term insurance will probably be the most cost-effective way to address survivor income needs, especially for minor children,\" said Marguerita Cheng, a CFP based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, also a member of CNBC\\'s Advisor Council.\\nPremiums can vary greatly from person to person. Insurers base them on a policy\\'s face value and the policyholder\\'s age, gender, health, family medical history, occupation, lifestyle and other factors.\\nThere are three main reasons it may make more sense to buy a permanent policy, despite the higher premiums, said McClanahan, founder of Life Planning Partners. This would aim to ensure there\\'s an insurance payout upon death, no matter when that occurs.\\nFor example, some beneficiaries such as kids with special needs may need financial help for a long time, and a policyholder\\'s lifetime savings wouldn\\'t be adequate to fund their needs, McClanahan said.\\nSome policyholders may also want to leave a financial legacy for family or charities. Additionally, others may have a relatively minor health complication with the potential to worsen later. At that point, the policyholder may be uninsurable, in which case, it\\'d be beneficial to buy a permanent policy today to ensure coverage later, McClanahan said.\\nSome shoppers buy permanent life insurance for the cash value, thinking they can borrow against that cash value or use it as a retirement savings account. But that\\'s a \"horrible reason\" to buy a permanent policy, said McClanahan, adding that the primary reason for buying a policy is always for an insurance need.\\nFor one, there may be taxes and penalties for accessing a policy\\'s cash value. Withdrawing or borrowing too much money from a permanent policy could cause the policy to lapse inadvertently, meaning the owner would lose their insurance.\\nPolicyholders should instead treat the cash value as an emergency fund at the end of one\\'s life, as the last asset someone taps, similar to home equity, McClanahan said.\\nProspective buyers should consider the \"three Ls\" when deciding how much life insurance to get: liability, loved ones and legacy, said Cheng, CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth.\\nFor example, if you die, how much money would you want to leave for liabilities such as a mortgage, student loans or auto loans? How much money would loved ones such as a spouse and kids need if they were to suddenly lose a policyholder\\'s income? How much would you want to leave as a legacy for causes that are important to you?\\nThinking about these questions will help guide the term of a policy, Cheng said.\\nCheng offered her personal situation as an example. She purchased a 20-year term policy with a $750,000 death benefit when all three of her kids were younger than age 18. Her husband also works and has a regular income. If Cheng were to have died prematurely, each child would have received $250,000 to fund their educations. She also bought $250,000 of permanent insurance, earmarked for Cheng\\'s husband, to help pay off their mortgage.\\nCoupling term and permanent insurance policies can help make an insurance purchase more cost-effective than buying just permanent insurance, advisors said.\\nThose buying a term policy should be sure to buy \"convertible\" term insurance, advisors said. This gives policyholders the option to convert their term policy into a permanent policy once the term has ended, but without having to undergo another round of medical underwriting. At that point, the person may be denied coverage if in poor health.\\n',\n",

Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 5.3% year on year. Both remained well above the ECB\\'s 2% target.\\nSpeaking to CNBC\\'s Annette Weisbach at the Sintra central bank meeting in Portugal on Tuesday, the former Central Bank of Ireland governor said the euro zone economy is in an \"adjustment phase,\" as higher rates feed through and wages attempt to catch up with price increases.\\n\"Where I do think the market should ask itself questions is about the timing or the speed of reversal of restrictive policy,\" Lane said.\\n\"We will not be back towards 2% for a couple of years. We will make good progress even this year, especially in the later part of the year, but it\\'s not going to collapse to 2% within a few months.\"\\nHis comments echoed those of ECB President Christine Lagarde, who said in a keynote address Tuesday that the central bank had made \"significant progress\" but \"cannot declare victory yet.\"\\nThe ECB has raised rates by 400 basis points since July 2022.

       "    'content': 'All 23 of the U.S. banks included in the Federal Reserve\\'s annual stress test weathered a severe recession scenario while continuing to lend to consumers and corporations, the regulator said Wednesday.\\nThe banks were able to maintain minimum capital levels, despite $541 billion in projected losses for the group, while continuing to provide credit to the economy in the hypothetical recession, the Fed said in a release.\\nBegun in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, which was caused in part by irresponsible banks, the Fed\\'s annual stress test dictates how much capital the industry can return to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. In this year\\'s exam, the banks underwent a \"severe global recession\" with unemployment surging to 10%, a 40% decline in commercial real estate values and a 38% drop in housing prices.\\nBanks are the focus of heightened scrutiny in the weeks following the collapse of three midsized banks earlier this year. But smaller banks avoid the Fed\\'s test entirely. The test examines giants including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, international banks with large U.S. operations, and the biggest regional players including PNC and Truist.\\nAs a result, clearing the stress test hurdle isn\\'t the \"all clear\" signal its been in previous years. Still expected in coming months are increased regulations on regional banks because of the recent failures, as well as tighter international standards likely to boost capital requirements for the country\\'s largest banks. \\xa0\\n\"Today\\'s results confirm that the banking system remains strong and resilient,\" Michael Barr, vice chair for supervision at the Fed, said in the release. \"At the same time, this stress test is only one way to measure that strength. We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks, and other stresses.\"\\nLosses on loans made up 78% of the $541 billion in projected losses, with most of the rest coming from trading losses at Wall Street firms, the Fed said. The rate of total loan losses varied considerably across the banks, from a low of 1.3% at Charles Schwab to 14.7% at Capital One.\\nCredit cards were easily the most problematic loan product in the exam. The average loss rate for cards in the group was 17.4%; the next-worst average loss rate was for commercial real estate loans at 8.8%.\\nAmong card lenders, Goldman Sachs\\' portfolio posted a nearly 25% loss rate in the hypothetical downturn — the highest for any single loan category across the 23 banks— followed by Capital One\\'s 22% rate. Mounting losses in Goldman\\'s consumer division in recent years, driven by provisioning for credit-card loans, forced CEO David Solomon to pivot away from his retail banking strategy.\\nThe group saw their total capital levels drop from 12.4% to 10.1% during the hypothetical recession. But that average obscured larger hits to capital — which provides a cushion for loan losses — seen at banks that have greater exposure to commercial real estate and credit-card loans.\\nRegional banks including U.S. Bank, Truist, Citizens, M&T and card-centric Capital One had the lowest stressed capital levels in the exam, hovering between 6% and 8%. While still above current standards, those relatively low levels could be a factor if coming regulation forces the industry to hold higher levels of capital.\\nBig banks generally performed better than regional and card-centric firms, Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin wrote Wednesday in a research note. Capital One, Citigroup, Citizens and Truist could see the biggest increases in required capital buffers after the exam, he wrote.\\nBanks are expected to disclose updated plans for buybacks and dividends Friday after the close of regular trading. Given uncertainties about upcoming regulation and the risks of an actual recession arriving in the next year, analysts have said banks are likely to be relatively conservative with their capital plans.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Have the money to buy a home? If you follow through, it may not be money well spent.\\nFor generations, Americans have thought of homeownership as a hallmark of success. Even today, 74% of U.S. adults say owning a home is a cornerstone of the American dream — ranking higher than milestones like retiring, having a good career, getting a college degree or having kids, according to a recent Bankrate poll.\\nBut there are reasons not to buy a home, even for those who can afford to do so.\\n\"I don\\'t think it should be an automatic for everyone,\" said certified financial planner Jude Boudreaux, senior financial planner with The Planning Center in New Orleans and a member of CNBC\\'s Financial Advisor Council. \"You could live your whole financial life renting and be very happy.\"\\nMore from Personal Finance:Term life insurance is often best but most buy another kindYour 401(k) plan may be worsening climate changeWhat Supreme Court case could mean for wealth tax ideas\\nHere are three reasons it may be smarter to rent. \\xa0\\nProspective homebuyers should have conviction about where they want to live, said Kamila Elliott, a CFP based in Atlanta and a member of CNBC\\'s Advisor Council.\\nFor example, would they enjoy living for several years in a particular city or suburb, or in a specific neighborhood? If they had relocated for a job, would they still want to live there if they lost that job? \\xa0\\nIf the answer to any of those questions is no, renting is likely best, said Elliott, co-founder and CEO of Collective Wealth Partners.\\n\"If you can\\'t commit to being there [at least] three years, don\\'t buy,\" said Elliott.\\nFlexibility is a big plus for renters, Boudreaux said.\\nFor example, if you move to an unfamiliar place, \"renting can be a nice pathway,\" he noted, in order to avoid buying and then discovering you don\\'t like the location.\\nThe benefits can be both psychological and financial.\\nHome prices can be volatile, making it more likely a buyer wouldn\\'t make a profit if selling after just a short period of ownership, Elliott said.\\nUpfront transaction costs like realtor\\'s fees are also generally \"very expensive,\" making it harder to break even on a short-term home purchase, Boudreaux said.\\nThere\\'s also a certain lifestyle benefit to renting instead of buying, advisors said.\\nRenters don\\'t have to deal with the \"nuisance factor\" of scheduling appointments with landscapers and exterminators or paying for home repairs, Elliott said. That\\'s typically a landlord\\'s responsibility.\\n\"You don\\'t have to worry about fixing the dishwasher, garage door, or HVAC unit,\" Elliott said.\\nDepending on the building, renters may feel safer if there are additional security cameras or a doorman, or get convenience and social benefits if there are amenities like a gym or pool, she added.\\nConversely, a house may be the right lifestyle choice for someone who wants a big yard with a nice garden and room for a dog to run around, Boudreaux said.\\nThe financial benefits of homeownership are \"vastly overstated,\" Boudreaux said.\\n\"Buying a home because you feel it\\'s the thing you should do can be [financially] dangerous\" and lead to regret, he added.\\nFor one, a financial assessment of affordability is incomplete if consumers only compare monthly rent and mortgage costs. The true cost of homeownership also includes costs for utilities, home improvements and maintenance, property taxes, and homeowners insurance, advisors said.\\nThe average homeowner paid more than $15,000 a year in addition to their mortgage to cover these costs in 2022, according to Clever Real Estate.\\nSecondly, a tax deduction for mortgage interest isn\\'t as valuable as it once was, Boudreaux added.\\nA 2017 tax law passed during the Trump administration reduced the mortgage interest threshold; married couples can claim a tax deduction on the first $750,000 of their mortgage, down from $1 million.\\nIn a general sense, it\\'s also more difficult to get the financial benefits of a tax deduction. The law doubled the standard deduction (it\\'s $27,700 in 2023 for married couples) and capped a deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000.\\nTaken together, a tax break for mortgage interest \"is not the benefit it used to be,\" Boudreaux said.\\nOf course, owning a home is often seen as an investment, as well as securing a place to live.\\nHomeownership \"allows families to build wealth and serves as a measure of financial security,\" according to a 2018 paper by Laurie Goodman of the Urban Institute and Christopher Mayer of Columbia University. Home equity can play an important role in retirement savings, for example, if retirees are able to tap that wealth, they wrote. \\xa0\\nBut there are \"substantial variations\" in homeowner experience based on factors like purchase timing, holding period and location, they said.\\nFor example, wealth building depends on one\\'s ability to hold on to a home during downturns; lower-income and minority borrowers are less likely to do so, and thus benefit less from homeownership, Goodman and Mayer wrote. Additionally, homeowner returns \"have been less favorable\" in areas like Cleveland and Chicago relative to other metro areas like Los Angeles, Dallas and New York.\\nHistorically, residential real estate returns and those of stocks have been \"very similar and high,\" according to a paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which examined global investments from 1870 to 2015. \\xa0\\nBut in the U.S., investors have gotten a better net return on stocks relative to housing during that time: 8.3% versus 6% a year, on average, after accounting for inflation, according to the paper.\\n',\n",

Storms are forecast across swaths of the U.S. heading into the weekend.\\nA technology issue may also snarl air travel this weekend. Starting Saturday, wireless carriers will be allowed to boost their 5G signal power, and planes that aren\\'t retrofitted with certain equipment to prevent interference from such transmissions won\\'t be allowed to land when visibility is poor, as during bad weather, said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\\n\"It\\'s a whole mix of factors,\" said Kimberly Palmer, personal finance expert at NerdWallet. \"We do expect to see a lot of delays, unfortunately.\"\\nTravelers affected by a flight disruption may have some recourse. But the rules differ depending on the situation and airline.\\nFederal law doesn\\'t require airlines to pay compensation to passengers for delays, Palmer said.\\nIf airlines cancel a flight for any reason, passengers are legally entitled to a full refund, including for ticket price, taxes, baggage fees, extra charges and ancillary fees. Travelers must receive that refund within seven business days if they paid by credit card, and within 20 days if by cash or check.\\n\"You don\\'t have to accept a rebooking, voucher or anything,\" Murray said. \"They have to give you a refund if that\\'s what you want.\"\\nOf course, that policy doesn\\'t necessarily help defray other incurred costs, such as food and lodging, or help travelers who would rather continue to their destination instead of accept a refund.\\nHere, airlines have some discretion to dole out money — especially if a delay or cancellation is their fault and not due to something beyond their control, such as bad weather.\\n\"There\\'s no reason not to ask,\" Palmer said.\\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation\\'s Airline Customer Service Dashboard outlines passenger rights for specific airlines. The list outlines commitments made by the 10 largest carriers in the event of \"controllable\" cancellations and delays.\\n\"These aren\\'t suggestions,\" Murray said of the commitments. \"It\\'s binding.\"\\nFor example: All major carriers will rebook passengers on the same airline at no additional cost for \"significant\" delays and will cover meals if there\\'s a delay of three hours or more. Some will rebook on a partner airline at no additional cost.\\nAll major airlines — except for Frontier — will cover a hotel stay and transportation to the hotel in the event of an overnight cancellation. Six of 10 will rebook on another airline at no extra cost. Just two airlines offer credits or travel vouchers if a cancellation causes a wait of at least three hours.\\nEven if a delay isn\\'t their fault, many airlines will transfer your ticket to another airline\\'s flight with available seats at no additional cost — if you ask, according to the U.S. PIRG Education Fund.\\nOf course, none of these options help travelers who, in the face of a flight disruption, opt for another mode of transit, such as a rental car, Palmer said.\\n\"I think this is a really common situation for people\" that could come with \"a lot of extra costs,\" she said.\\nHere are some general travel tips from experts to reduce the odds that a delayed or cancelled flight will affect you.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Shrewd business legend Warren Buffett has a whimsical side, buying companies whose products he personally enjoys like Dairy Queen and See\\'s Candies. Now count plush toy phenomenon Squishmallows.\\nSquishmallows made its Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting debut this year in Omaha, Nebraska, with shareholders snapping up 10,000 snuggly dolls in the span of hours, including ones modeled after the \"Oracle of Omaha\" and his longtime business partner Charlie Munger. Berkshire inherited Squishmallows parent Jazwares through its acquisition of Alleghany in the\\xa0fourth quarter of 2022.\\nJazwares founder and CEO Judd Zebersky and president Laura Zebersky now report to and are in regular communication with Greg Abel, Berkshire\\'s vice chairman for non-insurance operations and Buffett\\'s successor. The South Florida-based couple, who are lawyers-turned-toy-entrepreneurs, said they are excited to be under the Berkshire umbrella and enjoy having the autonomy to run their own business.\\n\"It\\'s an amazing structure. We\\'re thrilled to be part of it,\" Laura Zebersky said in an interview. \"It\\'s better than we could have ever anticipated and being around the greatest leaders in the world is phenomenal, and being able to explore the synergies is also something we are interested in.\"\\nThe 92-year-old Buffett sang Abel\\'s praises recently, saying he\\'s taken on most of the responsibilities. Abel has been overseeing a major portion of Berkshire\\'s sprawling empire, including energy, railroad and retail.\\nWhile Buffett only got into Jazwares indirectly through Alleghany, he has shown the willingness to invest in far smaller businesses that don\\'t have the heft to move the needle in terms of Berkshire\\'s massive earnings and revenue. Often Buffett admires the business\\' management and expects it to continue to grow and remain profitable.\\nA whopping 100 million Squishmallow units — with prices ranging from $5 to $30 — were sold last year alone. Laura Zebersky said the pandemic turbocharged Squishmallows\\' growth. Endorsements from celebrities from Kim Kardashian to Lady Gaga on TikTok also helped.\\n\"The idea of having something that was nurturing, cozy, cuddly, it was affordable and accessible. Instant gratification,\" Zebersky said. \"We really touch on all walks and areas. So it\\'s been really interesting to see that it\\'s not just kids, it\\'s adults. Our demographic is very wide and broad and it\\'s very unusual in our business to have that.\"\\nIn April 2020, Jazwares bought toymaker Kellytoy, which created the Squishmallow brand in 2017.\\nIn order to sustain the success of Squishmallows, Jazwares is conscious about oversaturation and tends to be very selective about partnerships, Zebersky said. The plush toy brand has driven 40% of Jazwares\\' entire revenue for the past two years.\\n\"We\\'re on year six of the brand ... it\\'s not a flash in the pan,\" Zebersky said. \"It\\'s growing smartly and sustainably. We make sure we limit the amount of production. We make sure that there\\'s something different for each channel of retail, that there\\'s collectability, that there\\'s unique styles, unique sizes.\"\\nSquishmallows recently announced a partnership with McDonald\\'s Happy Meal, which will roll across 70 different countries throughout 2023.\\nLast month, Jazwares participated in VidCon in California, an annual convention for content creators and online brands. The company featured a pit stuffed with a sea of Squishmallows for visitors to jump into.\\n\"We don\\'t do traditional marketing. We are where our fans are. And a great example of that is VidCon, the largest gathering of influencers,\" Zebersky said.\\nSquishmallows is one of Jazwares\\' fully owned intellectual property, but the company also sells products with licensed partnerships with Disney and Pokemon, etc.\\n',\n",

People seem genuinely impressed by the company\\'s technology, but the device is notably heavy for long wear, and some users were left with questions about what the headsets will ultimately be used for.\\nIf you missed it,\\xa0Apple\\xa0announced its headset on Monday\\xa0during its Worldwide Developers Conference. The $3,499 headset is its first major new product since the Apple Watch in 2014 and is set to launch early next year.\\nThe Vision Pro will allow users to see apps in a new way, in the spaces around them. Users can use their eyes and hands to navigate through apps and search with their voices. The headset can be used to watch movies, including in 3D, with spatial audio, view pictures or videos, and play video games. It can also be used for work with videoconferencing apps,\\xa0Microsoft\\xa0Office tools or\\xa0Adobe\\xa0Lightroom.\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\'s Joanna Stern said the Vision Pro was intuitive to use, has the \"fit and finish\" of an Apple gadget, and is more comfortable than Meta Quest Pro or Quest 2. But even so, she said, \"It\\'s not for everyone. It\\'s not even for most people.\" By the end of the demo, she said her nose and forehead were feeling the weight of the device, and she experienced some nausea.\\xa0\\nStern said Apple showed her a number of different demos, and she said she thinks the most valuable initial uses for the Vision Pro will be for watching movies and working.\\xa0\\xa0\\n9to5Mac\\'s Chance Miller said that it was easy to get the Vision Pro to feel \"snug\" and that it was generally pretty comfortable. He wore the device for 30 minutes and said he could understand that it might be heavy to wear for extended sessions.\\xa0\\nHe said there was a bit of a learning curve to figure out the right gestures to use, but that the \"eye and hand control gestures were really impressive.\" He did not experience any motion sickness.\\xa0\\nMiller said consuming content like movies, TV shows and sports games was particularly impactful: \"The experience is absolutely incredible.\"\\nThe Verge\\'s Nilay Patel said the device is a \"really, really nice VR headset\" with impressive video passthrough and displays. \"It is easily the highest-resolution VR display I have ever seen,\" he said.\\nBut, Patel said even after using the Vision Pro, he did not have a clear answer for what the headsets will ultimately be used for.\\nTechCrunch\\'s Matthew Panzarino said the Vision Pro is \"nothing less than a genuine leapfrog in capability and execution\" of mixed reality. He said that the gesture control and eye tracking on the device is \"near perfect,\" and he found that the resolution made text easy to read.\\nMovies were also a highlight for Panzarino: \"3D Movies are actually good in it,\" he wrote.\\nHe said that the headset is \"really, really well done,\" but that he isn\\'t sure whether the headset will really bring about the onset of spatial computing like Apple claims.\\nStratechery\\'s Ben Thompson said he found the Vision Pro experience \"extraordinary,\" and that it surpassed his high expectations. He said the user interface feels natural, and that it is \"surprising\" how high resolution it is.\\nHe said critics are right to question what the device will be used for. Thompson suspects a lot of early Vision Pro users will likely buy the device because they are \"Apple super fans\" or because they are \"interested in its novelty value.\"\\nThompson wondered if the Vision Pro might become the world\\'s \"most expensive paper weight.\"\\nEven so, he said he suspects the Vision Pro is \"the future of the Mac.\"\\'\\nWired\\'s Lauren Goode said the Vision Pro\\'s best selling point is its ability to adjust the immersion level of the virtual environment. She said the headset also \"shone\" in the entertainment category because of the dynamic experience, and she found that it was intuitive to use.\\nGoode said the headset felt \"hefty,\" even with the external battery pack, and her face \"breathed with relief\" when she took it off. She added that, unlike other Apple devices, this one can\\'t disappear into a pocket or a bag, so it requires some \"suspension of disbelief and a sacrifice of autonomy\" to use it.\\n\"Even Apple can\\'t out-design its way out of what is fundamentally an obtrusive technology,\" Goode wrote.\\nThe Financial Times\\' Patrick McGee\\xa0said the Vision Pro has an \"intuitive interface that is novel and intimate,\" and that it was entertaining to view photos, watch movie clips and take a call.\\nMcGee said despite the impressive nature of the technology, he said it \"is difficult to make the case that any consumer \\'needs\\' this device.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nGoogle\\'s cloud business is expanding its use of new artificial intelligence technologies in health care, giving medical professionals at Mayo Clinic the ability to quickly find patient information using the types of tools powering the latest chatbots.\\nOn Wednesday, Google Cloud said Mayo Clinic is testing a new service called Enterprise Search on Generative AI App Builder, which was introduced Tuesday. The tool effectively lets clients create their own chatbots using Google\\'s technology to scour mounds of disparate internal data.\\nIn health care, that means workers can interpret data such as a patient\\'s medical history, imaging records, genomics or labs more quickly and with a simple query, even if the information is stored across different formats and locations. Mayo Clinic, one of the top hospital systems in the U.S. with dozens of locations, is an early adopter of the technology for Google, which is trying to bolster the use of generative AI in the medical system.\\nMayo Clinic will test out different use cases for the search tool in the coming months, and Vish Anantraman, chief technology officer at Mayo Clinic, said it has already been \"very fulfilling\" for helping clinicians with administrative tasks that often contribute to burnout.\\nFor instance, if a physician needs to see information about a cohort of female patients aged 45 through 55, including their mammograms and medical charts, they can enter that query into the search tool instead of seeking out each element separately. Similarly, if a physician needs to know which clinical trials a patient may match, they can search for that, too.\\n\"It\\'s going to save a lot of time, it\\'s going to prevent physician burnout, it\\'s going to reduce administrative overload,\" Anantraman told CNBC in an interview.\\nGenerative AI has been the hottest topic in tech since late 2022, when Microsoft-backed OpenAI released the chatbot ChatGPT to the public. Google raced to catch up, rolling out its Bard AI chat service earlier this year and pushing to embed the underlying technology into as many products as possible. Health care is a particularly challenging industry, because there\\'s less room for incorrect answers or hallucinations, which occur when AI models fabricate information entirely.\\nAashima Gupta, global director of health care strategy and solutions at Google Cloud, said Google is taking a \"safety over speed\" approach with its Enterprise Search tool, which is why the company has limited it to select early adopters like Mayo Clinic instead of rolling it out more broadly.\\n\"We want to be very thoughtful and responsible in how we leverage such a powerful tool like generative AI in an enterprise setting, especially in health care,\" Gupta told CNBC in an interview.\\nGoogle said its approach to privacy ensures customers retain control over their data and noted the new service is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\\nAnantraman said Mayo Clinic has created \"safe sandboxes\" for workers to test applications of the technology and identify where it can be the most helpful.\\n\"We take privacy of patient data very, very seriously, and our needs of our patients come first,\" he said. \"That\\'s one of the reasons health care has to be very cautious in general as an industry in adopting technology that may not be fully tested, may not be fully vetted.\"\\nGoogle Cloud and Mayo Clinic signed a 10-year partnership in 2019. Mayo said at the time it selected Google Cloud to be the \"cornerstone of its digital transformation.\" The partnership announced Wednesday is the first step in an expanded agreement between the two companies to work together on AI applications in health care.\\nWATCH: CNBC\\'s interview with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'LONDON — Australian graphic design company Canva believes it is in a \"uniquely strong position\" to withstand industry headwinds as it embarks on a European expansion.\\nThe Sydney-based software company opened its new Europe headquarters in London last month as it competes with tech heavyweights Adobe and Microsoft to attract individual and enterprise users to its design suite.\\nIt comes as higher borrowing costs and a weakening economic outlook have prompted tech firms to slash jobs over the past year. But co-founder and CEO Melanie Perkins said the nine-year-old company is well-placed amid wider pressures.\\n\"Being profitable for the last six years, having a strong cash balance, all of those things have been extraordinarily important,\" Perkins told CNBC.\\nCanva, which offers both free and paid tools for designing websites, presentations and social content, had annualized revenues of $1.5 billion in the year to May. It also has $700 million in cash reserves, the company said.\\nOf its 135 million global users, 16% are in Europe. Overall, around 15% are paid subscribers, of which 14 million are individuals and 6 million are businesses such as WPP, Unilever and Rolls Royce. It is now targeting growth in both those areas.\\n\"We\\'ve made our paid products extremely affordable, so regardless of what\\'s happening in the macroeconomic environment, people are moving to Canva rather than away,\" Perkins said of the service.\\n\"We\\'ve certainly seen that happen and play out over the last couple of years as that economic uncertainty has kicked in,\" she added.\\nCanva, a 2023 CNBC Disruptor, has not been immune from industry setbacks, however.\\nDespite reaching a peak valuation of $40 billion in 2021, the private company has since seen investors cut their valuations amid the darkening outlook. It also narrowly avoided implication in the collapse of start-up financer Silicon Valley Bank in March.\\nMeantime, growing scrutiny around artificial intelligence has coincided with the firm\\'s rollout of a new suite of AI-powered editing, publishing and design features, which attracted 10 million new users in the space of a month. Amid the fanfare surrounding the burgeoning technology, it has preferred to euphemistically dub the tools \"magic.\"\\n\"That term \\'magic\\' has been what we\\'ve referred to things as for almost a decade, and so that branding has been something we\\'ve carried through,\" Perkins said.\\nTech experts have increasingly been raising alarm bells about the threats AI poses to society, with Tesla CEO Elon Much and Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker\\xa0OpenAI, among those to voice concerns.\\nCanva has partnered with OpenAI for its Magic Write tool, which auto-generates full bodies of text for presentations and blogposts based on prompts of a few words. But Perkins said the company is moving ahead cautiously, \"over-indexing towards trust and safety.\"\\n\"There\\'s a lot of terms you can\\'t do in Magic Write. There\\'s no medical, no political, there\\'s a lot of categories that we\\'ve actually said it\\'s too risky at this point in time. We\\'re erring on the side of caution because this industry is so in its infancy,\" she said.\\nThe creative industry is among those thought to be at risk of disruption by forthcoming tech advancements, with some platforms already capable of producing images and content previously produced by designers.\\nStill, Perkins said the tools are intended to streamline and simplify design processes, which she believes will \"supercharge\" what people can do.\\n\"Every industry goes through radical transformations. Certainly, our industry\\'s not been distant from that,\" Perkins said. \"As new technology becomes available, the whole industry has to adapt and everyone has to learn new skills. I think that\\'s just happened time and time again.\"\\n\"When we launched Canva, people were like \\'oh, is this going to be the end of graphic design\\' and it certainly hasn\\'t been the case. I think we\\'ve seen a much more prolific spread and demand for graphic design and visual communication across all organizations,\" she added.\\nAs the business approaches its 10th anniversary in August, it is hoping that continued adoption could fuel their ambitions to amass 1 billion users and become one of the world\\'s most valuable companies.\\nAsked whether that user target could occur within the next decade, Perkins said she was hopeful. However, on the prospect of a potential initial public offering, she was less forthcoming. \"There\\'s nothing to speak of at this point,\" she said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nJust as the periodic table is foundational to chemistry and the Human Genome Project revolutionized modern genetics, researchers at the Allen Institute for Brain Science have teamed up with Amazon Web Services to create what could become a \"transformative\" new resource for the field of neuroscience.\\xa0\\nAWS on Wednesday announced its technology will support the Allen Institute as it builds a map of the human brain, called the Brain Knowledge Platform. This platform, the first of its kind, is designed to be a complete reference of individual cells in the brain, and should eventually serve as the world\\'s largest open-source brain cell database.\\xa0\\nTo build the new platform, the Allen Institute is using single cell genomics technologies. Researchers measure the genes used by individual brain cells to create a \"cell fingerprint,\" and cells with similar fingerprints will be grouped into \"cell types,\" resulting in a high-resolution map of the entire brain.\\xa0\\nOnce the reference is complete, scientists should better understand links between genetics and different cognitive functions. Researchers believe the platform could provide insights into why diseases like Alzheimer\\'s and Parkinson\\'s occur.\\xa0\\n\"This really is like the periodic table for the brain,\" Dr. Ed Lein, senior investigator at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, said Wednesday during a presentation about the platform in Washington, D.C. \"It\\'s revealed in dramatically higher complexity than we\\'ve ever had access to before.\"\\nThe Allen Institute is a nonprofit research institute based in Seattle. It\\'s made up of several different institutes, including one that focuses on neuroscience, and is perhaps best known for creating a number of different large-scale data resources.\\xa0\\xa0\\nBut even though the Allen Institute is no stranger to data, there are hundreds of billions of cells in the brain — so creating a reference like the Brain Knowledge Platform means researchers will have to contend with massive amounts of data.\\xa0\\n\"We\\'re just running into these enormous, enormous problems of data size,\" Lein said during a briefing with reporters Wednesday. \"The scale of data just keeps getting bigger and bigger.\"\\nAs such, the Allen Institute is leveraging AWS\\' cloud computing and machine learning to standardize and consolidate complex brain data into one place.\\xa0\\nWhen carrying out research involving genetics and imaging, scientists are often working with petabytes and even exabytes of data. Dr. Rowland Illing, director of international public sector health at AWS, said at the briefing that consuming 40 petabytes of data would require someone to watch 4K video for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for 100 years.\\xa0\\nThe amount of data available to researchers is expected to keep growing in coming years, but Lein said there is also a lot of existing brain data in the neuroscience field. The problem, he said, is that much of it is disorganized and decentralized, which makes it difficult for researchers to access.\\xa0\\nThe Allen Institute plans to use AWS\\' technology to successfully interpret this disparate data even if it\\'s stored across different formats and locations, which Lein said will hopefully further democratize access to knowledge and bring parts of the neuroscience community together.\\xa0\\n\"While this is really in its early phases now, the goal of the Brain Knowledge Platform is to transform this fragmented landscape of neuroscience information into a unified ecosystem,\" he said.\\nThe Allen Institute will work to build the Brain Knowledge Platform over the next five years. Lein said it is still in its early phases, but the potential for the tech is immense.\\xa0\\n\"If we can do this, imagine the impact on the field,\" he said. \"We can unify the disparate parts of the field that can\\'t talk to one another at the moment. We can accelerate our understanding of brain function, as well as new approaches for treating diseases.\"\\n',\n",

Net income reached $3.32 billion, or $1.19 per share, compared with $3.19 billion, or $1.16 per share, in the year-ago quarter.\\nCEO Safra Catz said on a conference call that she expects fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.12 to $1.16 per share and 8% to 10% revenue growth. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected $1.14 in adjusted earnings per share on $12.34 billion in revenue, which implies 7.8% growth.\\nThe company\\'s top source of revenue, cloud services and license support, jumped 23% to $9.37 billion. But revenue from cloud licenses and on-premises declined 15% to $2.15 billion.\\nRevenue from cloud infrastructure totaled $1.4 billion, which was up 76%, accelerating from 55% growth in the prior quarter. That part of Oracle is expanding faster than Microsoft and Google but it\\'s still much smaller than that of their rivals. Oracle\\'s gross margin in the unit will continue to expand, Catz said on the call.\\nLarry Ellison, Oracle\\'s chair and technology chief, said the company will introduce a generative artificial intelligence cloud service tied to a partnership with startup Cohere, which has agreed to using Oracle\\'s cloud infrastructure. Microsoft, which has a partnership with startup OpenAI, offers the Azure OpenAI Service, allowing organizations to deploy large language models for taking human input and generating human-like responses.\\n\"This new service protects the privacy of our enterprise customers\\' training data, enabling those customers to safely use their own private data to train their own private specialized large-language models,\" Ellison said. Oracle has started using the tool internally, he said.\\nDuring the quarter, Oracle said more of its cloud services had received approval for use by U.S. defense and intelligence agencies.\\nExcluding the after-hours move, Oracle shares have climbed almost 43% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up around 13%.\\nThe stock rose 6% in regular trading, its best day in a year, after Wolfe Research analysts upgraded the stock to the equivalent of a buy from a hold based on improving financials along with the company\\'s position in AI.\\nWATCH: Oracle named top pick at Jefferies\\n',\n",

Easterly was responding to a question about the recently disclosed Chinese infiltration of U.S. military and private sector infrastructure.\\nThe attacking group was dubbed \"Volt Typhoon\" by Microsoft and was overtly linked to the Chinese government\\'s cyber-offensive capacities. Easterly warned that in the event of open conflict between the U.S. and China, Americans should expect that similar hacking groups would target pipelines and railways. \"It\\'s going to be very, very difficult for us to prevent disruptions from happening,\" Easterly said.\\n\"We, as an American people, need to understand not just cyber resilience but the imperative of operational resilience and the importance of societal resilience,\" the CISA director said.\\nThe blunt warning comes at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. Corporate executives have far less insight into potential Chinese partners or customers than they did even a year ago. Fending off cyber threats from China and Asia has become a top priority for the U.S. government, which has begun to describe in clearer and blunter terms the links between the Chinese government and myriad hacking groups.\\nChinese cyber infiltration and espionage have been an ongoing concern for American companies. Intellectual property theft has been used by Chinese companies to reach parity with American competitors.\\nBut the clear and present danger underlined by Easterly suggests that the U.S. government has become increasingly willing to highlight the risks beyond espionage. A disruption of critical pipelines, communications infrastructure, or transportation services could cripple the U.S. economy in the case of conflict.\\nThe Colonial Pipeline cyber intrusion, for example, disrupted airlines and caused gas shortages across the East Coast. That attack by Russian hackers initially cost the company $5 million.\\n\"I think that this is the most important issue for anyone who runs or operates critical infrastructure is that we need to be prepared for disruptive attacks,\" Easterly said. \"Now, I hope that doesn\\'t happen.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nThe Federal Trade Commission on Monday applied for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to block Microsoft\\'s acquisition of Activision Blizzard before the deal\\'s July 18 deadline.\\nCNBC reported on the FTC\\'s plans earlier in the day.\\nThe FTC said it fears that should Microsoft be allowed to buy Activision, Microsoft would have the power to \"withhold or degrade\" Activision\\'s gaming products, through price, game quality, experience on competitors\\' offerings or \"withholding content from competitors entirely.\"\\nIn other words, the FTC is worried that Microsoft could withhold popular games from Activision Blizzard\\'s library from launching on other game consoles, like those sold by Sony. Or it could charge more for games that launch on other consoles. Call of Duty is one title that has come up and, while it\\'s currently available across platforms and Microsoft has promised to continue to sell that series of games broadly, regulators fear that Microsoft could have the power to hold those or similarly popular future titles for Xbox, taking buyers away from Sony and other console makers.\\nIf the parties were allowed to merge before the case made its way through an administrative proceeding, the FTC argued that \"reestablishing the status quo would be difficult, if not impossible.\"\\nThe injunction request comes as the deadline for the deal was coming down to the wire. Both the FTC\\'s hearing date, and that of an appeal to the decision by the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. to block the deal, are to occur after the parties\\' deadline of July 18. Meanwhile, European Commission regulators had cleared the acquisition.\\nThe FTC told the court that a preliminary injunction was necessary, \"because Microsoft and Activision have represented that they may consummate the Proposed Acquisition at any time.\"\\nMicrosoft announced its intent to buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in January 2022 in what would be its largest transaction to date. At the time, the software maker said it expected to complete the deal by the end of June 2023. If the deal falls apart, Microsoft might wind up owing Activision Blizzard a termination fee worth up to $3 billion.\\nThe FTC sued to block the acquisition in December 2022, choosing to bring the case before its internal administrative law judge. A hearing on the FTC\\'s case will begin on Aug. 2, the agency said in Monday\\'s filing.\\nIn an administrative case, the in-house judge issues a decision that can be appealed to the full commission. Should the commission vote against Microsoft and Activision, they could appeal the case to a federal court.\\n\"We welcome the opportunity to present our case in federal court,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said. \"We believe accelerating the legal process in the U.S. will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market.\"\\nActivision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said in an email to employees that the company welcomed the FTC\\'s decision to discuss the planned transaction in a federal court.\\n\"Our excellent legal team has been preparing for this move for more than a year, and we\\'re ready to present our case to a federal judge who can evaluate the transaction on the merits,\" he wrote.\\nSmith was scheduled to meet last week with U.K. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt regarding the deal, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people.\\nIn May, the European Union\\'s executive arm approved the deal after initially saying it was worried it would reduce competition. Regulators had originally felt that Microsoft might be able to prevent other companies from distributing Activision Blizzard games on other consoles other than Microsoft\\'s Xbox.\\nMicrosoft offered its main rival in consoles, Sony, a decadelong contract to make every Call of Duty game available on Sony PlayStation at the same time the Xbox gets it. But Sony has not accepted.\\n\"I don\\'t want a new Call of Duty deal.

       "    'content': 'AMSTERDAM — Artificial intelligence has a racial bias problem.\\nFrom biometric identification systems that disproportionately misidentify the faces of Black people and minorities, to applications of voice recognition software that fail to distinguish voices with distinct regional accents, AI has a lot to work on when it comes to discrimination.\\nAnd the problem of amplifying existing biases can be even more severe when it comes to banking and financial services.\\nDeloitte notes that AI systems are ultimately only as good as the data they\\'re given: Incomplete or unrepresentative datasets could limit AI\\'s objectivity, while biases in development teams that train such systems could perpetuate that cycle of bias.\\nNabil Manji, head of crypto and Web3 at Worldpay by FIS, said a key thing to understand about AI products is that the strength of the technology depends a lot on the source material used to train it.\\n\"The thing about how good an AI product is, there\\'s kind of two variables,\" Manji told CNBC in an interview. \"One is the data it has access to, and second is how good the large language model is. That\\'s why the data side, you see companies like Reddit and others, they\\'ve come out publicly and said we\\'re not going to allow companies to scrape our data, you\\'re going to have to pay us for that.\"\\nAs for financial services, Manji said a lot of the back-end data systems are fragmented in different languages and formats.\\n\"None of it is consolidated or harmonized,\" he added. \"That is going to cause AI-driven products to be a lot less effective in financial services than it might be in other verticals or other companies where they have uniformity and more modern systems or access to data.\"\\nManji suggested that blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, could serve as a way to get a clearer view of the disparate data tucked away in the cluttered systems of traditional banks.\\nHowever, he added that banks — being the heavily regulated, slow-moving institutions that they are — are unlikely to move with the same speed as their more nimble tech counterparts in adopting new AI tools.\\n\"You\\'ve got Microsoft and Google, who like over the last decade or two have been seen as driving innovation. They can\\'t keep up with that speed. And then you think about financial services. Banks are not known for being fast,\" Manji said.\\nRumman Chowdhury, Twitter\\'s former head of machine learning ethics, transparency and accountability, said that lending is a prime example of how an AI system\\'s bias against marginalized communities can rear its head.\\n\"Algorithmic discrimination is actually very tangible in lending,\" Chowdhury said on a panel at Money20/20 in Amsterdam. \"Chicago had a history of literally denying those [loans] to primarily Black neighborhoods.\"\\nIn the 1930s, Chicago was known for the discriminatory practice of \"redlining,\" in which the creditworthiness of properties was heavily determined by the racial demographics of a given neighborhood.\\n\"There would be a giant map on the wall of all the districts in Chicago, and they would draw red lines through all of the districts that were primarily African American, and not give them loans,\" she added.\\n\"Fast forward a few decades later, and you are developing algorithms to determine the riskiness of different districts and individuals. And while you may not include the data point of someone\\'s race, it is implicitly picked up.\"\\nIndeed, Angle Bush, founder of Black Women in Artificial Intelligence, an organization aiming to empower Black women in the AI sector, tells CNBC that when AI systems are specifically used for loan approval decisions, she has found that there is a risk of replicating existing biases present in historical data used to train the algorithms.\\n\"This can result in automatic loan denials for individuals from marginalized communities, reinforcing racial or gender disparities,\" Bush added.\\n\"It is crucial for banks to acknowledge that implementing AI as a solution may inadvertently perpetuate discrimination,\" she said.\\nFrost Li, a developer who has been working in AI and machine learning for more than a decade, told CNBC that the \"personalization\" dimension of AI integration can also be problematic.\\n\"What\\'s interesting in AI is how we select the \\'core features\\' for training,\" said Li, who founded and runs Loup, a company that helps online retailers integrate AI into their platforms. \"Sometimes, we select features unrelated to the results we want to predict.\"\\nWhen AI is applied to banking, Li says, it\\'s harder to identify the \"culprit\" in biases when everything is convoluted in the calculation.\\n\"A good example is how many fintech startups are especially for foreigners, because a Tokyo University graduate won\\'t be able to get any credit cards even if he works at Google; yet a person can easily get one from community college credit union because bankers know the local schools better,\" Li added.\\nGenerative AI is not usually used for creating credit scores or in the risk scoring of consumers.\\n\"That is not what the tool was built for,\" said Niklas Guske,\\xa0chief operating officer at Taktile, a startup that helps fintechs automate decision-making.\\nInstead, Guske said the most powerful applications are in pre-processing unstructured data such as text files — like classifying transactions.\\n\"Those signals can then be fed into a more traditional underwriting model,\" said Guske. \"Therefore, Generative AI will improve the underlying data quality for such decisions rather than replace common scoring processes.\"\\nBut it\\'s also difficult to prove. Apple and Goldman Sachs, for example, were accused of giving women lower limits for the Apple Card. But these claims were dismissed by the New York State Department of Financial Services after the regulator found no evidence of discrimination based on sex.\\xa0\\nThe problem, according to Kim Smouter, director of the group European Network Against Racism, is that it can be challenging to substantiate whether AI-based discrimination has actually taken place.\\n\"One of the difficulties in the mass deployment of AI,\" he said, \"is the opacity in how these decisions come about and what redress mechanisms exist were a racialized individual to even notice that there is discrimination.\"\\n\"Individuals have little knowledge of how AI systems work and that their individual case may, in fact, be the tip of a systems-wide iceberg. Accordingly, it\\'s also difficult to detect specific instances where things have gone wrong,\" he added.\\nSmouter cited the example of the Dutch child welfare scandal, in which thousands of benefit claims were wrongfully accused of being fraudulent. The Dutch government was forced to resign after a 2020 report found that victims were \"treated with an institutional bias.\"\\nThis, Smouter said, \"demonstrates how quickly such dysfunctions can spread and how difficult it is to prove them and get redress once they are discovered and in the meantime significant, often irreversible damage is done.\"\\nChowdhury says there is a need for a global regulatory body, like the United Nations, to address some of the risks surrounding AI.\\nThough AI has proven to be an innovative tool, some technologists and ethicists have expressed doubts about the technology\\'s moral and ethical soundness. Among the top worries industry insiders expressed are misinformation; racial and gender bias embedded in AI algorithms; and \"hallucinations\" generated by ChatGPT-like tools.\\n\"I worry quite a bit that, due to generative AI, we are entering this post-truth world where nothing we see online is trustworthy — not any of the text, not any of the video, not any of the audio, but then how do we get our information? And how do we ensure that information has a high amount of integrity?\" Chowdhury said.\\nNow is the time for meaningful regulation of AI to come into force — but knowing the amount of time it will take regulatory proposals like the European Union\\'s AI Act to take effect, some are concerned this won\\'t happen fast enough.\\n\"We call upon more transparency and accountability of algorithms and how they operate and a layman\\'s declaration that allows individuals who are not AI experts to judge for themselves, proof of testing and publication of results, independent complaints process, periodic audits and reporting, involvement of racialized communities when tech is being designed and considered for deployment,\" Smouter said.\\nThe AI Act, the first regulatory framework of its kind,\\xa0has incorporated a fundamental rights approach and concepts like redress, according to Smouter, adding that the regulation will be enforced in approximately two years.\\n\"It would be great if this period can be shortened to make sure transparency and accountability are in the core of innovation,\" he said.\\n',\n",

Vodafone appointed Margherita Della Valle\\xa0as permanent CEO in April to transform the business.\\nThe combination of Vodafone\\'s U.K. business and Three UK will reduce the number of mobile operators in the country to just three, after major consolidation in the telecommunications sector in the past few years.\\nVodafone and Three were lagging behind larger rivals EE, which is owned by BT, and O2, which is owned by Telefonica and Liberty Global via a joint venture. BT acquired EE in 2016, while Telefonica and Liberty Global launched Virgin Media O2 in 2021.\\nThe deal will need approval from the U.K.\\'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) which has become increasingly-powerful and looked to hamper big mergers and acquisitions. Last month, the CMA moved to block Microsoft\\'s $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard.\\nThe merger is expected to complete before the end of 2024 and remains subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals — with some analysts questioning whether it will pass the finish line. \\nBack in 2016, the European commission blocked Three\\'s takeover of British telecommunication company O2 on competition concerns, setting a precedent that may prove challenging to overcome. \\n\"This will be a hard sale given that both companies have been outperforming the market for the last year or so,\" said Paolo Pescatore, tech, media and telco analyst at\\xa0PP Foresight. \"Let\\'s see if the authorities have a change of heart. Both parties need to demonstrate that this is genuinely in the interest of UK plc, the economy, and consumers for it to have a chance of getting over the line.\" \\nVodafone and CK Hutchison touted the benefits of the tie-up, saying it will \"deliver up to £5 billion per year in economic benefit by 2030, create jobs and support digital transformation of the UK\\'s businesses\" and that \"every school and hospital in the UK will have access to standalone 5G by 2030.\\nIn a potential bid to sweeten the appeal of the deal to regulators, the new combined company will also invest £11 billion ($13.91 billion) in the U.K. over 10 years \"to create one of Europe\\'s most advanced standalone 5G networks, in full support of UK Government targets.\"\\n\"An £11 billion network investment plan will seek to allay regulatory concerns. But this deal will still face a major challenge to win approval. At this stage, I believe it is too difficult to call either way,\"  CCS Insight\\'s Mann said. \\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Oracle is having a moment.\\nFor years, the database software developer lagged behind tech rivals in building cloud technology that met the demands of the modern-day enterprise. But that\\'s changing, and Wall Street is quite pleased with what it sees from Larry Ellison\\'s 46-year-old company.\\nOracle shares climbed 4.8% on Wednesday to $122.24, closing at a record for a fifth straight day and the eighth time this month. The stock is up 73% over the past 12 months, outperforming all large-cap enterprise tech stocks over that stretch other than Nvidia. The shares are up over 50% in 2023, which would mark the best year for shareholders since the dot-com boom of 1999.\\nOracle got its latest boost this week after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue, prompting nods of approval from analysts. Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on the stock to the equivalent of hold from sell.\\nWithin hours of the earnings report, Bloomberg declared that Ellison had reached the No. 4 spot on its ranking of billionaires, his highest spot to date. He surpassed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.\\n\"Let\\'s give him credit where it\\'s finally due,\" said Eric Lynch, managing director of Scharf Investments, which held $163 million worth of Oracle shares at the end of the first quarter, according to regulatory filings. \"The upside case is finally coming through.\"\\nThe story that\\'s exciting investors these days? No surprise. It\\'s artificial intelligence.\\nPrior to the latest rally, Oracle was largely viewed as a technology has-been rather than an innovator. In the red-hot cloud market, it had lost market share to Salesforce in selling software to sales reps, and was a bit player in infrastructure as a service (IaaS), where Amazon, Microsoft and Google were leading the way. Oracle picked up significant business from TikTok and Zoom, but big names were mostly going elsewhere.\\nNow, Oracle is seeing accelerated growth thanks to the craze around generative AI, the technology that can craft images or text from a few words of human input. The company is a significant investor in Cohere, an enterprise-focused generative AI startup whose technology can power copywriting, search and summarization.\\xa0\\nCohere is valued at over $2 billion and\\xa0ranked No. 44 on CNBC\\'s 2023 Disruptor 50 List.\\nOn the earnings call, Ellison told analysts that customers have \"recently signed contracts to purchase more than $2 billion of capacity\" on what Oracle calls its Gen 2 Cloud.\\nAfter its market cap fell below that of the younger Salesforce in 2020, Oracle reclaimed the lead the following year, and now it\\'s not even close. Oracle is worth $330 billion as of Wednesday\\'s close while Salesforce sits at $204 billion.\\nOracle is even growing faster, with revenue in the latest quarter increasing 17% from the prior year, compared to 11% at Salesforce.\\nCloud infrastructure revenue at Oracle surged 76% from a year earlier, surpassing growth of 55% the prior quarter. That\\'s one data point that analyst Kash Rangan and his Goldman Sachs colleagues highlighted in their upgrade.\\nThe analysts said the acceleration is \"a clear signal that Oracle\\'s advertised price/performance advantage vs. the hyperscalers is resonating with the market (both net new and existing customers), which should position the company for durable share gains despite its late entry into IaaS.\"\\nEven with the cloud infrastructure growth, Oracle management called for no change to capital expenditures in the new 2024 fiscal year, which bodes well for free cash flow generation, the Goldman analysts said.\\nLike several enterprise-focused technology companies, Oracle started selling cloud-based versions of applications that clients had previously run in their on-premises data centers. The company expanded its reach with the $9.1 billion acquisition of NetSuite in 2016.\\nRebuilding the guts of the data center was less straightforward, and Oracle quickly fell behind. In 2009, Ellison dismissed the rise of cloud-computing branding.\\n\"Our industry is so bizarre,\" he said. \"You know, they just change a term, and they think they\\'ve invented technology.\"\\nEllison made a bad bet. Between 2010 and the end of 2020, not only did Oracle\\'s stock badly underperform Amazon, Microsoft and Google, but just buying an S&P 500 tracking index would have returned almost double what an investor would have made on Oracle.\\nOracle eventually came around to charging organizations for servers, storage and networking services based on how much they used, following in the path of the market leaders.\\nThe company introduced the Elastic Compute Cloud in 2015, nine years after the launch of Amazon Web Services\\' foundational EC2 computing service. Then, in 2018, Oracle debuted its Gen 2 Cloud portfolio.\\nIn October, Ellison said he thought Oracle had been copying rivals, so he canceled the existing cloud effort and pushed for a new approach. As organizations look for ways to reduce IT spending, Ellison on Monday told analysts that Oracle\\'s cloud database can be faster and cheaper than what\\'s available from AWS.\\nLynch, whose Los Gatos, California-based investment firm took a stake in Oracle in 2011, recalled that people used to poke fun at Ellison for his earnings call routine of reciting the names of small-time operations that had signed up for Oracle\\'s cloud services. The company was still appealing to value-oriented investors, because it had a strong balance sheet due to a huge roster of legacy clients, and boasted stronger profit margins than many of its peers.\\nNow, Ellison can reel off big brands using his company\\'s cloud. Oracle called out Dollar Tree, Exxon Mobil and Pfizer as cloud customers during its fiscal fourth quarter.\\nLynch acknowledged that Oracle appears to be enjoying its position in the AI gold rush and said he doesn\\'t expect such high growth in cloud infrastructure to persist.\\nFor the time being, Ellison can enjoy his company\\'s bragging rights in Silicon Valley with so many high-profile and once high-flying neighbors downsizing for the first time in their history. Oracle has had some layoffs but a relatively smaller number than its peers.\\nOn Oracle\\'s earnings call this week, CEO Safra Catz took a minute to express gratitude to the company\\'s customers and employees.\\n\"Some of you are new, and many of you have been with us for years, in fact, even decades, and I think you all see that our best days are in fact ahead of us,\" she said. Catz then thanked Ellison \"for leading with brilliance, determination and vision and allowing us to all be part of this incredible journey, which is just getting started.\"\\nWATCH: Oracle \\'multiple years late\\' in A.I. race despite post-earnings surge, says Jefferies\\' Brent Thill\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nEarlier this spring, the emergency department at the Cleveland Clinic told Dr. Rita Pappas it had a problem.\\xa0\\nThe Cleveland Clinic is the largest hospital system in Ohio, but after an influx of patients came in, the emergency department did not believe it could accommodate all the people who would need care.\\xa0\\nPappas, the Cleveland Clinic\\'s medical director for the admission and transfer center, disagreed.\\xa0\\nThe Cleveland Clinic was in the midst of trying new AI-powered software from Palantir. The system was predicting that there would be a large number of discharges that day, meaning there would be enough space for all the incoming patients.\\xa0\\nPappas and her team convinced the emergency department to give Palantir\\'s platform a chance, and — to her relief — the new system worked.\\xa0\\n\"It was perfect. We were able to accommodate all the patients, and so everyone was cheering, they were so happy,\" Pappas, who also practices clinically as a pediatric hospitalist, told CNBC in an interview. \"Everyone got really excited. I was very excited because I do not want to have the emergency department yelling at me.\"\\nOrdinarily, Pappas said managing patient flow in a similar scenario would require constant communication, every hour throughout the night. But by accurately predicting patient discharges, Palantir\\'s system saved Pappas, her team and the emergency department a lot of time and effort.\\nPalantir partnered with two health-care systems, Cleveland Clinic and Tampa General Hospital in Florida, during the summer of 2021 to develop software called Palantir for Hospital Operations. Now, just two years later, the company says its hospital-operations platform accounts for around 10% of its commercial revenue in the U.S.\\nThe software translates complex data into digestible information that health-care workers can use to guide their decision-making and resource allocation. It can be used to generate real-time and predictive insights into areas like staffing, wait times and hospital-bed assignments.\\nShyam Sankar, the company\\'s chief technology officer, said he thinks Palantir for Hospital Operations is just getting started.\\xa0\\n\"I\\'m so excited that we\\'re at 13% of beds in the U.S., but you know, like 90% of the work is in front of us here,\" Sankar told CNBC in an interview.\\xa0\\nPalantir specializes in data analytics, and shares of the company are up around 150% so far this year as bullish AI investors are buying into its tech offerings. The company reported its first quarterly net profit for Q4 2022, and Palantir CEO Alex Karp said in a May letter to shareholders that the company expects to remain profitable \"each quarter through the end of the year,\" and that demand for its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is \"without precedent.\"\\nThe company is perhaps best known for its work with the U.S. government\\'s defense and intelligence agencies, but despite its high-profile customers in government, Sankar said Palantir works to tackle hard challenges across a variety of industries, including health care — a field that experts widely believe is in crisis.\\xa0\\nNurses and physicians are experiencing high levels of burnout, and staffing shortages across the country have made it difficult for hospital systems to keep up with patient demand. These challenges were magnified by the Covid pandemic, as nearly 63% of physicians reported symptoms of burnout in 2021, up from 38% the prior year, according to a recent study co-authored by the American Medical Association.\\nCompanies across the medical and technology fields have been working to build solutions that could bring health-care workers some relief. But unless the new platforms, tools and services can be easily integrated into workflows, physicians and nurses often find they can be more trouble than they\\'re worth.\\xa0\\n\"If you don\\'t build it in the workflow of the user, it actually doesn\\'t get used, it just sits on the shelf,\" Dr. Peggy Duggan, executive vice president and chief medical officer of Tampa General, told CNBC in an interview.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs such, in the summer of 2021, a team of four Palantir employees set out to create a meaningful solution that health-care workers at Cleveland Clinic and Tampa General could actually use. It was a daunting challenge, and there was an additional catch: They were only given a matter of weeks to build something worthwhile.\\nDrew Goldstein and Jeremy David led Palantir\\'s team of four, and they now run its fast-growing U.S. commercial health-care team. The pair said they were given around 12 weeks to build a solution for Tampa General, and their work in Florida was already underway when the Cleveland Clinic\\'s chief information officer called to give them an even shorter timeline: eight weeks.\\xa0\\n\"For better or for worse, I\\'m quite hopeful and optimistic,\" David said in an interview with CNBC. \"I was like, \\'Eight weeks? We can get something live in three.\\'\"\\xa0\\nDavid, Goldstein and their two teammates took an intense, hands-on approach to building their hospital-operations software.\\xa0\\nThey spent their allotted time on the ground in the hospitals in both Ohio and Florida, shadowing doctors and nurses during their shifts, even overnight. They asked questions about existing workflows and tried to grasp the biggest pain points for each organization, an experience Goldstein said was both \"overwhelming\" and \"exciting.\"\\xa0\\nTo their surprise, the Palantir team learned that hospital staff were carrying out some of their operations by manually entering data into spreadsheets and configuring information like scheduling on paper and whiteboards.\\xa0\\nThe Palantir team also became acquainted with whiteboards, as Goldstein said much of their early efforts in Ohio were spent trying to draw out existing workflows with hospital-operations leadership.\\xa0\\n\"It was so foundational in our understanding of what these problems could look like,\" Goldstein told CNBC in an interview.\\nAt the Cleveland Clinic, the Palantir team initially focused on addressing challenges related to patient flow, particularly around accelerating aspects of the patient-discharge process, while they trained their focus on clinical-staffing allocation at Tampa General. But before long, Goldstein said it became clear the health systems shared both of those problems.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\"So then, instead of just building these completely separately, we started to think about, like, what should the product look like to be able to solve this?\" Goldstein said.\\nWhen their work was done in Florida and Ohio, Palantir\\'s team had what amounted to an early iteration of Palantir for Hospital Operations. David said it was the product of several 100-hour weeks where he and Goldstein, who have become good friends, often lived in adjoining hotel rooms.\\xa0\\n\"Drew didn\\'t like that,\" David joked. \"[I\\'d] knock on his door, \\'Good morning, Sunshine!\\'\"\\xa0\\nDavid said the team\\'s hands-on approach was essential in order to understand what support\\xa0health-care workers truly needed.\\xa0\\n\"If you treat the nurses and patients like widgets, you\\'re going to lose,\" David said. \"For about two weeks, we tried to treat them like widgets, and we lost.\"\\nThe group presented their work to hospital leadership through a series of demos and testimonials, and David said it was clear the health systems believed Palantir had created something special.\\xa0\\nTheir next challenge, Goldstein said, was to keep building and execute on a broader, longer-term vision.\\xa0\\nThe Cleveland Clinic officially launched Palantir\\'s platform in March.\\xa0\\nPappas said the hospital system had considered working with other companies, but that the Palantir team stood out because they truly listened to the staff\\'s needs.\\xa0\\nShe said the Cleveland Clinic wanted help building a system that could optimize the number of patients staff could see, while also ensuring that they were all being cared for safely. Pappas said Palantir\\'s engineers not only took their concerns seriously but got psyched when they were able to build successful solutions.\\n\"It sounds silly, but everyone had this, \\'Oh, we did it!\\' moment,\" she said.\\xa0\\nAs the medical director for the admission and transfer center, Pappas works with a bed-management team to place patients throughout the hospital. Prior to using Palantir\\'s platform, they relied on Microsoft Teams and Excel spreadsheets to carry out their operations.\\xa0\\nNow, Pappas said they have easy access to both real-time and predictive insights on the number of patients coming into the hospital\\'s operating rooms, emergency department and as direct admissions, which are patients who receive treatments like chemotherapy.\\xa0\\n\"The system is actually learning and taking information, and it\\'s very accurate,\" she said. \"It serves as a command center so that we can see very clearly how many patients we are going to be caring for every day.\"\\nSince the official launch of Palantir\\'s software on March 1, the Cleveland Clinic main campus has been able to accept an 8% increase in patient transfers from other hospitals.\\xa0\\nIn fact, Palantir\\'s system proved to be so useful that Pappas said some members of her team expressed fear that they were going to be replaced by it. Once she reassured them that the platform is just meant to serve as a tool, she said they\\'ve grown to love it.\\xa0\\n\"They\\'ve developed a trust in the system,\" Pappas said. \"People in health care are kind of conservative, you know, don\\'t like change, and so the fact that they trusted and are using it now really just says to us that it\\'s a successful venture for us.\"\\nDuggan said staff at Tampa General, particularly nurses, are also very fond of Palantir\\'s technology. She acknowledged that it is still the \"early days\" of the partnership, but the software company passed its first test by building a staffing model that nursing managers can use to find team members who are available for shifts. Duggan said this process is often conducted manually, so automating it has saved Tampa General\\'s staff significant time and energy.\\xa0\\n\"The nurse leaders love it,\" she said. \"It\\'s right in their workflow; it makes their day easier and they love it. They love all that technology support.\"\\xa0\\nDuggan said once the Palantir team managed to solve the staffing problem, it was clear the company would be able to use its software to tackle challenges across several different areas of the hospital. Palantir is now working on a series of projects at Tampa General, and Duggan said she is particularly impressed by how it is helping clinicians handle cases of sepsis, the No. 1 killer in hospitals nationwide.\\xa0\\nSepsis occurs when a patient\\'s body has an extreme response to an infection. Once diagnosed, Duggan said patients have to stay on a pathway of treatment over the next few days in order to increase chances of survival.\\xa0\\nPalantir built a monitoring system for the sepsis pathway at Tampa General, which helps the clinicians ensure the patients are getting the care they need. She said it can also help provide insights as to why a patient might not have received antibiotics, for instance.\\xa0\\nDuggan said it is new but exciting territory, and it has allowed Tampa General to identify variability in some of its most important work.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\"Our work in sepsis definitely has decreased early mortality by about half, and so that\\'s real lifesaving,\" she said. \"I tell people that it\\'s people\\'s mothers, sisters, cousins, right? That\\'s real lifesaving for sure.\"\\nMeanwhile, Palantir\\'s commercial health-care team has ballooned from four employees to more than 50, and Goldstein said the rapid growth has been unexpectedly challenging to learn to manage.\\xa0\\nBut as they plan to partner with more health systems, expand their own team and continue to refine their technology in the years ahead, David said the potential for innovation makes for a truly exciting time.\\xa0\\n\"I think we really solved this core problem, where it\\'s like, OK, a health system actually can deploy this really transformative platform technology to the front lines of health care,\" he said. \"There\\'s this old trope that\\'s like banks and hospitals don\\'t adopt technology — that is definitively not true anymore.\"\\n',\n",

The rules are the first comprehensive regulations for AI.\\nWhat generative AI is capable of, from producing music lyrics to generating code, has wowed academics, businesspeople and even school students. But it has also led to worries around job displacement, misinformation, and bias.\\nDuring a critical Wednesday vote, the Parliament adopted the AI Act with 499 votes in favor, 28 against and 93 abstentions. The regulation is far from becoming law, but it is likely to be one of the first formal rules for the technology globally.\\nEuropean Parliament members agreed to bring generative AI tools like ChatGPT under greater restrictions. Generative AI developers will be required to submit their systems for review before releasing them commercially.\\nThe Parliament also decided to hold firm with a ban on real-time biometric identification systems, as well as controversial \"social scoring\" systems.\\nHuman rights campaigners had expressed concern over an attempt by the European People\\'s Party to water down the ban. Lawmakers nevertheless pressed ahead with it and agreed to prohibit biometric surveillance from all public settings.\\nThe laws have huge implications for developers of generative AI models, such as the Microsoft-backed OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT and Google\\'s Bard.\\nJens-Henrik Jeppesen, senior director of public policy at Workday, said the AI Act aims to \"build safeguards on the development and use of these technologies to ensure we have an innovation-friendly environment for these technologies such that society can benefit from them.\"\\n\"Those are the right goals in my view,\" he told CNBC after the vote.\\nThe next stage is for negotiators at EU institutions, such as the EU executive body and 27 member states.\\nEarlier in the day, Github CEO Thomas Dohmke called on European regulators to listen to the private sector, as it pushed ahead with rules for AI.\\n\"We encourage the European Union and the US government to move really fast and listen to those that built the technology, not only in the commercial business, but also in universities, in the open-source communities,\" Dohmke told CNBC\\'s Arjun Kharpal.\\nIt comes as countries around the world are looking to bring in rules and standards for AI.\\nOn Monday, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made a bold pitch to make the U.K. the \"geographical home\" of AI safety regulation.

I have also reminded the telecoms operators concerned that it is time to get to grips with this issue.\"\\xa0\\nTo date, only 10 EU countries have restricted or banned Huawei from their 5G networks, Breton said.\\n\"For our part, the Commission will implement the 5G toolbox principles to its own procurement of telecoms services, to avoid exposure to Huawei and ZTE,\" Breton said.\\nChina subsequently said that it firmly opposes some EU countries\\' ban on Huawei, and that the Commission has no legal basis to prohibit the firm, according to Reuters, which cited a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson.\\nBreton\\'s comments follow news that Germany is considering whether to ban Huawei and ZTE from its 5G network because of alleged national security risks. In response, China\\'s embassy in Germany said it was \"puzzled and strongly dissatisfied\" by the reports.\\n\"Huawei strongly opposes and disagrees with the comments made by representatives from the European Commission,\" a Huawei spokesperson told CNBC. \"This is clearly not based on a verified, transparent, objective and technical assessment of 5G networks.\"\\n\"Huawei understands the European Commission\\'s concern to protect cybersecurity within the EU. However, restrictions or exclusions based on discriminatory judgments will pose serious economic and social risks. It would hamper innovation and distort the EU market.\"\\nA ZTE spokesperson described the Commission\\'s proposed actions as \"unfortunate\" and said they \"do not appear to be based on any specific articulable concerns.\"\\n\"ZTE strongly agrees that the safety and security of 5G networks in EU member states is of essential importance,\" the ZTE spokesperson said. \\n\"ZTE\\'s products are secure, and comply with all technical and regulatory standards in EU member states. No evidence has been presented to date that would suggest otherwise. ZTE\\'s only request is to be treated fairly and objectively by regulators and legislators - just like any other vendor.\"\\nThe U.S. and its allies, including the U.K. and Australia, have barred Huawei from operating in their 5G networks.\\nWashington officials allege that Huawei and ZTE technology could be used by Beijing for espionage Both companies and Beijing have denied the allegations.\\nThe EU has previously described China as a \"partner,\" \"economic competitor,\" and \"systemic rival.\"\\nHowever, more recently, it has leant towards the \"system rival\" part of that, seeking to keep China close as a partner while also staying wary of its growing influence in development of critical technologies.\\nUrsula von der Leyen, the European Commission\\'s president, said in a speech earlier this year that she thinks the bloc should reevaluate its ties with Beijing — though she said it was not in the EU\\'s best interests to \"decouple\" from China. Instead, she said, it should look to \"de-risk\" its relationship with China.\\nOperators have struggled to replace Huawei as the provider of infrastructure in their mobile networks. Industry executives say Huawei\\'s technology is often cheaper and more advanced than that offered by rivals such as Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'PARIS — France is making a major push to position itself as Europe\\'s hub for artificial intelligence, throwing its weight behind the fast-growing and much-hyped technology.\\n\"I think we are number one [in AI] in continental Europe, and we have to accelerate,\" French President Emmanuel Macron told CNBC\\'s Karen Tso last week.\\nCountries are looking to position themselves as AI hubs, because the technology is seen as revolutionary and therefore of strategic importance to governments around the world. AI is viewed as impacting industries from finance to healthcare, but has also been caught in the middle of the broader technology battle playing out between China and the U.S.\\nHype around AI has been partly sparked by the viral nature of U.S. firm OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT chatbot.\\nAI was the phrase on everyone\\'s lips at France\\'s annual technology conference Viva Tech, from startups to established technology firms, along with companies from industries as diverse as cosmetics and banking.\\nMacron, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and Digital Minister Jean-Noel Barrot attended the event, adding the government\\'s backing to France\\'s tech push.\\n\"We will invest like crazy on training and research,\" Macron told CNBC, adding that France is well-positioned in AI due to its access to talent and start-ups forming around the technology.\\nWhile the U.S is seen as the leader in AI by many measures, France hopes to catch up.\\n\"Believe me this is clear that the U.S. is number one, for good reason because it is a huge domestic market ... I want us to clearly bridge the gap and invest much more, develop much more and accelerate much more,\" Macron said.\\nParis\\' ambitions face tough competition even within the European Union.\\n\"France definitely has a chance to be the leader in Europe, but it faces stiff competition from Germany and the U.K.,\" Anton Dahbura, Co-Director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Assured Autonomy, told CNBC via email.\\nU.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in the past week made his pitch for Britain to become a global AI center.\\nDahbura said that, for France to find success, it will need to \"use AI to build on the economic areas it\\'s already strong in,\" such as manufacturing and pharmaceutical.\\n\"It\\'s a key time to be strategic to identify specific areas of distinct competency and invest heavily in AI to build an edge,\" Dahbura said.\\nU.S. companies currently dominate the conversation around AI, with names such as Microsoft — which invested in OpenAI — and chipmaker Nvidia staying top of mind.\\nFrance doesn\\'t have an AI giant like the U.S., but wants to create two or three \"big global players\" in the technology, according to Macron.\\nit is banking on its startups to grow quickly. Underscoring the potential and hype of AI developments, four-week-old French startup Mistral AI raised 105 million euros to fund the company. A number of other local startups were showing off their wares at Viva Tech.\\nPart of France\\'s pitch to be an A.I. hub leads on regulation around the technology.\\nThe European Parliament greenlit the EU AI Act, a wide-sweeping first-of-its-kind regulation on artificial intelligence. It is not yet law, but, if passed, would bring a risk-based approach to regulation across the EU.\\nFrance has typically been seen as a proponent of strong regulation on technology — but it has taken issue with parts of the EU AI Act related to generative AI, the type of technology that underpins OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT, which it sees as too stringent.\\n\"My worry is that in the recent past few weeks, the EU Parliament … has taken a very sort of strong stance on AI regulation, using, in some sense, this AI act as a way to try and solve too many problems at once,\" Barrot, France\\'s digital minister, said on the provisions around generative AI.\\nFrance desires a global regulation on A.I., which it hopes to achieve through the G7 group that includes the U.S. and Britain, as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\\n\"From my point of view … I think we do need a regulation and all the players, even the U.S. players, agree with that. I think we need a global regulation,\" Macron said.\\nFrance sees the U.S. as both a rival and an ally. French and European companies will try to compete with U.S. giants like Microsoft and Google, but Washington\\'s by-in is required for any kind of global regulation .\\n\"Competition is always a good thing. So we have a very close cooperation with the U.S., but we also want to get access to our own AI intelligence and companies. So I think that having a fair competition between the U.S. and Europe and also a co-operation on some key devices is good for the U.S. and good for Europe,\" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, told CNBC.\\n\"On regulation as well, I think this is absolutely vital to have an in-depth discussion with the American authorities on the best way of regulating artificial intelligence.\"\\n',\n",

It would be inappropriate for me to continue serving as Chairman and CEO of both companies at the same time during the spin-off process.\"\\nZhang said the decision to step down was part of his own plan.\\nZhang\\'s intentions to only focus on cloud now have been some years in the making. In an interview with CNBC in 2018, Zhang said cloud computing will be the company\\'s \"main business\" in the future, underscoring his bullishness regarding the technology.\\nRead the full memo Zhang sent to Alibaba employees:\\nMy fellow Aliren,\\nSince becoming CEO of Alibaba Group in May 2015, it has become my custom to send several letters to everyone every year. As many of you have come to expect when receiving such a letter, it often signals a significant organizational change. Today is no exception. This time, however, the news I\\'m sharing involves an important personal change.\\nI am pleased to report that our organizational transformation into the \"1+6+N\" model has been progressing as planned since we made the announcement. During our most recent earnings announcement, we introduced the board of directors for each of the six major business groups, and these entities are now all fully operational. We also announced plans for a series of significant transactions, which include Cloud Intelligence Group\\'s full spin-off and listing as an independent company, IPOs for Cainiao Smart Logistics and Freshippo, and external capital raising for AIDC. Alibaba will have a brand-new outlook for the future.\\nAs everyone is well aware, the development of core technologies such as cloud computing, big data and AI will lead to a tremendous transformation of our society and is of utmost strategic significance. Cloud Intelligence Group is now full speed ahead on its spin-off plans and we are approaching a crucial stage of the process, so it is the right time for me to dedicate my full attention and time to the business. From a corporate governance perspective, we also need clear separation between the board and management team as Cloud Intelligence Group proceeds down the path to becoming an independent public company. It would be inappropriate for me to continue serving as Chairman and CEO of both companies at the same time during the spin-off process. Therefore, the Alibaba board of directors has discussed and accepted my plan to transition from the role of Chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group to focus exclusively on my role as Chairman and CEO of Cloud Intelligence Group, effective September 10th 2023. In turn, the Alibaba board of directors has appointed Joseph C. Tsai to succeed me as Chairman and Eddie Yongming Wu to succeed me as Chief Executive Officer. As co-founders and partners of the company, Joe and Eddie have made significant contributions to the company\\'s development and possess a wealth of invaluable experience. I have every confidence that their leadership will guide Alibaba toward new heights.\\nThis change signifies a new phase and new journey, not only for the company but also for me personally. Time flies, and this year marks my 16th year at Alibaba Group. My appointment as CEO and Chairman of Alibaba Group was beyond my imagination. Being able to fully dedicate myself to the roles for as long as I have is truly due to the trust, support, encouragement, and patience I have received from everyone. For this, I am forever deeply grateful. Due to the historical opportunities that emerged through social progress and market development over the past 16 years, I had the privilege of witnessing the rapid growth of Alibaba and participated alongside everyone in so many achievements from inception to maturation that has impacted people\\'s everyday lives, enabled the digital transformation of businesses, and made positive contributions to society. Together we withstood the challenges brought about by the pandemic and weathered the uncertainties of the macro environment over the past three years. Through prosperity and adversity, we grew stronger, shared unforgettable experiences, and persevered through it all together. I am grateful for the friendships and bonds forged during this journey that is more valuable and meaningful to me than anything else.\\nOver the past 24 years, we have initiated self-reinvention many times. Today, we are all standing together at a new starting point, hoping to unlock new growth through self-transformation. I know everyone will continue to support Joe, Eddie, and the new senior management team. I hope everyone will find the best path and platform for themselves. Your self-fulfilment will benefit society and the company, but more importantly, hopefuly will help you discover how to be the best version of yourself. The team at Cloud Intelligence Group and I are also standing on a brand new stage, and we will leverage the power of new technology in cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence to serve the digital transformation of enterprises of all sizes and industries and capture the massive potential brought about by AI. I am incredibly eager and excited.\\nMy friends, the landscape may evolve, but the mountains remain and the rivers will continue to flow. Let\\'s start a new chapter.

A spokesperson for the FTC declined to comment further.\\nGoogle singled out Microsoft in the complaint, arguing that through its dominant Windows Server and Microsoft Offices products, the company can make it difficult for its massive roster of clients to use anything but its Azure cloud infrastructure offering. Google described Microsoft\\'s licensing restrictions as a \"complex web\" that prevents businesses from diversifying their enterprise software vendors.\\nGoogle also said such control represents a significant national security and cybersecurity risk. It highlighted successive cyberattacks involving Microsoft products, including the SolarWinds breach.

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nAmazon\\'s cloud unit said Thursday that it\\'s allocating $100 million for a center to help companies use generative artificial intelligence, the technology that\\'s taken off in the months since OpenAI unleashed its ChatGPT chatbot on the public.\\nIt\\'s a small investment for a company with $64 billion in cash and half a trillion dollars a year in operating expenses. But the announcement shows that Amazon Web Services recognizes the significance of the current moment in generative AI and the importance of being in the conversation, alongside rivals Microsoft and Google.\\n\"You ask yourself the question — where are the different runners three steps into a 10K race?\" AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said in an interview this week with CNBC. \"Does it really matter? The point is, you\\'re three steps in, and it\\'s a 10K race.\"\\nAs part of the latest announcement, Amazon said it will be adding some data scientists, engineers and solutions architects to the payroll. AWS said the center is already working with Highspot, Twilio, RyanAir and Lonely Planet. The company told CNBC that it\\'s a \"program\" rather than a physical center.\\nAmazon, which beat Microsoft and Google to the business of renting out servers and data storage to companies and other organizations, enjoys a commanding lead in the cloud infrastructure market. However, those rivals have had splashier entrances into generative AI, even though Amazon has drawn broadly on AI for years to show shopping recommendations and operate its Alexa voice assistant.\\nMicrosoft has been spending billions on a multilayered alliance with OpenAI, and Google is moving quickly to deploy AI tools it\\'s built in-house for consumers and businesses.\\nNor does Amazon have the first popular large language model that can enable a chatbot or a tool for summarizing documents.\\nSelipsky said he isn\\'t concerned. He joined the company in 2005, a year before the launch of AWS\\' core services for computing and storage. Echoing Amazon founder and longtime CEO Jeff Bezos, Selipsky said the company has succeeded by listening to customers.\\n\"Amazon has had many examples in its history where it said, we\\'re going to focus on customers and have steadfast belief that we\\'re going to work with customers, we\\'re going to build what they want,\" Selipsky said. \"And if people want to perceive us in a certain way, we\\'re misunderstood, that\\'s OK, as long as customers understand where we\\'re going.\"\\nOne challenge Amazon currently faces is in meeting demand for AI chips. The company chose to start building chips to supplement graphics processing units from Nvidia, the leader in the space. Both companies are racing to get more supply on the market.\\n\"I think the whole world has a shortage in the short term of compute capacity for doing generative AI and machine learning in general right now,\" Selipsky said. People are impatient, and the situation will improve in the next few months, he added.\\nSelipsky is also reckoning with a slowdown in customer spending on cloud, as businesses prepare for ongoing economic uncertainty.\\n\"A lot of customers are largely through their cost optimization, but there have been other customers who are still right in the middle of it,\" he said. \"It\\'s hard to predict exactly when that particular trend will be over. But we\\'re still in the middle of it.\"\\nStill, the AI trend is real, he insists. For Amazon, that momentum applies to its Bedrock generative AI service and its Titan models as well as the new innovation center.\\n\"AI is going to be this next wave of innovation in the cloud,\" he said. \"It\\'s going to be the next big thing that pushes even more customers to want to be in the cloud. Really, you need the cloud for generative AI.\"\\nAlso, the way Selipsky sees it, AWS provides a measure of credibility in offering generative AI that eludes others in the space.\\n\"I can\\'t tell you how many Fortune 500 companies I\\'ve talked to who banned ChatGPT in the enterprise,\" Selipsky said. \"Because at least the initial versions of it just didn\\'t have that concept of enterprise security.\"\\nWATCH: Amazon lawsuit is test of what FTC considers \\'dark patterns\\'\\n',\n",

He added that the country\\'s tech scene models itself after Israel\\'s, which has produced numerous global tech successes, including self-driving tech firm Mobileye and the mapping app Waze.\\nTech Zity manages three tech campuses in Vilnius, including Tech Park, Tech Loft, and Tech Spa, which are home to companies like Google, Bored Panda and Kilo Health.\\nU.S. streaming platform Netflix has used Tech Zity locations for filming, including the docu-series \"The Playlist\" which focuses\\xa0 on Spotify founder Daniel Ek.\\nCurrently occupying 20,000 square meters, Tech Zity plans to reach 80,000 square meters over time, considering new campuses, existing locations, and other projects.\\nDespite its recent successes, Lithuania is far from becoming a major tech hub that rivals the likes of the U.K., France or Germany.\\nThe country attracted 222 million euros of venture capital funding in 2022, paling in comparison to its Western European peers. By contrast, U.K. tech startups raised $30 billion, while their French counterparts raised 13.5 billion euros.\\nBut the country has been drawing more interest from venture capitalists, according to local founders.\\n\"All the top VC firms are now coming to Lithuania and talking with startups, angel investors, and anyone else,\" Tom, CEO and co-founder of Nord Security, told CNBC on the sidelines of the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal, last November.\\n\"The last raise for a Lithuanian startup called Kevin was from Accel, Vineted has Insight Parnters, EQT, Accel, and many others.\"\\nWATCH: Russia sanctions must go further, Lithuania\\'s president says\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'As Microsoft attempts to convince regulators to approve its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company is revealing some of the other ways it\\'s looked to expand in the video game industry.\\nMicrosoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer testified in San Francisco on Friday that the company previously opened up talks with mobile game developer Zynga but ended up not consummating a deal. \\nThe hearing, which began on Thursday and will continue next week, came after the Federal Trade Commission gained a temporary restraining order to keep Microsoft from closing the Activision purchase. The court agreed to maintain the status quo as it reviewed the FTC\\'s request for a preliminary injunction for the deal.\\n\"A lot of respect for people at Zynga and what they built,\" Spencer said at the hearing. \"In the end, for our opportunity, we thought we needed to have something that was even bigger than what Zynga was, given our very small starting space in the mobile gaming business.\"\\nTake Two Interactive, the publisher of Grand Theft Auto titles and other games, ended up acquiring Zynga,  in May of last year for $12.7 billion. Zynga was originally for the Facebook hit social game FarmVille, before eventually expanding into mobile games, largely through acquisitions. \\nPrior to the Microsoft offer, Activision met with a financial firm to work on topping\\xa0Take-Two\\'s purchase of Zynga, CNBC reported at the time.\\nSpencer didn\\'t say when Microsoft was in talks with Zynga, and the company wouldn\\'t provide further comment. However, Zynga said in a filing last year that executives met in September 2021 with representatives from an unnamed \"strategic acquirer,\" which \"expressed non-specific interest in an acquisition of Zynga.\"\\nIt wasn\\'t the the first time Microsoft showed such interest. The company reportedly tried to buy Zynga in 2010. \\nIn trying to the get Activision deal over the finish line, Microsoft says that even if the two companies combine, the joint entity would be smaller than Sony, whose PlayStation console competes with Microsoft\\'s Xbox, as well as China\\'s Tencent.\\nSpencer said on Friday that mobile games represent a faster opportunity for growth than PC games and consoles, where Microsoft gets the bulk of its gaming revenue. Microsoft has tried to boost cloud-based game streaming on mobile devices, but that effort has challenges. They include the smaller typefaces on phone screens and the fact that smartphones don\\'t come with controllers, Spencer said. \\nAdditionally, Apple has stood in the way of bringing Microsoft\\'s Game Pass library of video games to its App Store, he said.\\nSpencer said that after the company went to Zynga, he worked with Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood to look for mobile opportunities. Activision was the biggest publisher of mobile content, and it was already a longtime Microsoft partner, he said.\\nActivision grew its portfolio of mobile games with the 2016 acquisition of King, publisher of Candy Crush Saga. About 35% of the company\\'s $8 billion in 2022 revenue came from its King segment. \\nWATCH: Microsoft-Activision Blizzard five-day hearing begins\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nThe typical playbook for a successful tech founder looks something like this.\\nStart a company with full ownership. Sell off significant chunks to venture investors as the business progresses. Eventually become a minority owner. Take the company public. Sell more stock over time.\\nAsana\\'s Dustin Moskovitz took that playbook and completely rewrote the ending.\\nMoskovitz, who is still known by many as a co-founder of Facebook, started Asana in 2008 to make work more collaborative through software. By the time he took the company public through a direct listing in 2020, his ownership stood at about 36%.\\nThen, he went on a buying spree. Following the purchase of 480,000 Asana shares in June, Moskovitz\\'s ownership swelled to 111.4 million shares, representing over 51% of outstanding stock. In March, Asana disclosed that Moskovitz had a trading plan to buy up to 30 million more of its Class A shares this year, sending the stock up almost 19% the next day.\\n\"It\\'s been a wild two years in the market and there have been some interesting buying opportunities,\" Moskovitz said in an interview with CNBC.\\nEven after rallying 66% this year, Asana shares are more than 80% below their record high from late 2021.\\nFor Moskovitz, who has a net worth over $12 billion — mostly from his early stake in Facebook, now Meta — becoming majority owner of Asana isn\\'t about control. Rather, he sees it as the best way to invest to support his philanthropy.\\nIn 2010, Moskovitz signed the Giving Pledge, a promise by some of the wealthiest people in the world to donate most of their fortunes to charity.\\xa0Moskovitz and his wife, former journalist Cari Tuna, dole out their funds through Good Ventures, based on recommendations from Open Philanthropy.\\nWhen it comes to spending that money, there\\'s no greater concern to Moskovitz than the future of artificial intelligence.\\nGood Ventures donated $30 million to startup OpenAI over a three-year period in 2017, long before generative AI or ChatGPT had entered the public lexicon. OpenAI, which is now worth about $30 billion, was started as a nonprofit, and Open Philanthropy said at the time it wanted \"to help play a role in OpenAI\\'s approach to safety and governance issues.\"\\nOne of the 10 focus areas Open Philanthropy lists on its website is \"potential risks from advanced AI.\" The organization recommended a $5 million grant to the National Science Foundation to back research on methods of guaranteeing the safety of artificial intelligence systems, and $5.56 million to the University of California at Berkeley for \"the creation of an academic center focused on AI safety.\" In total, Open Philanthropy says it\\'s given over $300 million in the focus area through more than 170 grants.\\n\"I definitely think there\\'s a big risk there — something I spend a lot of time thinking about,\" Moskovitz said.\\nMoskovitz co-founded Facebook with Mark Zuckerberg, Chris Hughes and Eduardo Saverin at Harvard University in 2004. He became a billionaire after Facebook\\'s 2012 initial public offering, holding more shares than any individual other than Zuckerberg.\\nEven after snapping up additional Asana shares in 2022 and 2023, his ownership sits at about $2.6 billion, less than the $4.6 billion in Facebook stock he owns, according to FactSet.\\n\"I\\'m just in a unique position, where I came to the table with an existing source of wealth,\" Moskovitz said. \"So even things that look like gigantic purchases, it\\'s still a relatively normal sort of portion of my net worth relative to other founders.\"\\nMoskovitz has agreed not to buy all outstanding Asana shares or even acquire ownership of 90% of the common stock. He will also keep a majority of its directors independent, in compliance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, according to a filing.\\nMoskovitz declined to talk about whether he was buying up shares to prevent activist investors from coming in and trying to force change. Activists have been busy in the cloud software space, most notably at Salesforce, which responded to pressure by expanding its buyback program and bolstering profits.\\nRecently, Moskovitz\\'s worlds collided.\\nOpenAI vaulted from niche startup to the hottest thing in tech after releasing ChatGPT in November. Before that, Moskovitz was playing around with the company\\'s DALL-E technology for converting text into images. He said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman set him up with a \"labs account\" in April of last year.\\nFollowing the ChatGPT launch, Moskovitz had some fun asking the chatbot to come up with objectives to help deal with California\\'s housing problem.\\nMeanwhile, Asana joined the parade of companies that announced enhancements to their products with generative AI features that could take human input and present text, images or audio in response. Earlier this month, Asana said it had given some clients access to several generative AI features powered by OpenAI\\'s models.\\n\"Chat is just one paradigm for how you use these technologies,\" Moskovitz told CNBC. \"When you\\'re integrating them into workflows like work management, doing things like optimizing automation workflows or helping to make decisions — you can literally ask questions of the system and it\\'ll give you a summary and a recommendation.\"\\nMoskovitz said more complicated tasks, such as adding structure to projects, is where \"it really sorts of takes off in potential.\" Rather than just asking for specific answers, he said the power is in the technology to take \"a bunch of information and sort of a vague goal\" and then \"give you something approximately in the right direction.\"\\nAsana could spend $5 million or more on OpenAI\\'s technology next year, Moskovitz said, adding he was \"very impressed by GPT-3,\" the company\\'s prior large language model, \"and was even more impressed by GPT-4,\" which was announced in March.\\nMoskovitz took six minutes out of Asana\\'s 51-minute earnings call in early June to tout the company\\'s approach to AI. He used the acronym 41 times, compared with 32 AI references by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on his company\\'s earnings call in April. Microsoft is OpenAI\\'s lead investor.\\nAsana is \"just personally deeply connected to the AI labs that are leading the way,\" Moskovitz said.\\nThe links are, in fact, quite deep. Altman invested in Asana in 2016. On Asana\\'s earnings call, Moskovitz reminded analysts that his company and OpenAI \"share a board member in Adam D\\'Angelo,\" a former Facebook technology chief who later started online Q-and-A startup Quora.\\nMoskovitz invested in AI startup Anthropic in 2021, the same year he co-invested with Altman in nuclear fusion startup Helion.\\nSimilar to Altman, Moskovitz is also deeply bullish on AI and worried about the damage it can cause.\\nMoskovitz was one of many entrepreneurs who signed a statement in May, saying that \"mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\" The missive came from the nonprofit Center for AI Safety.\\nBut Moskovitz wasn\\'t among the signatories of the nonprofit Future of Life Institute\\'s open letter in March that called on AI labs to press pause on training the most sophisticated AI models for six months or more. Near the top of that list of signees was Tesla CEO Elon Musk, an early backer of OpenAI who has warned we should be very concerned about advanced AI, calling it \"a bigger risk to society than cars or planes or medicine.\"\\nMoskovitz said Musk\\'s fears aren\\'t completely overblown and that they both want \"to bring this technology into the world in a safe way.\"\\n\"Elon kind of comes at it from multiple angles,\" he said. \"I think we sort of share the view about potential existential risk issues, and maybe don\\'t share the view as much about AI censorship and wokeism and stuff like that.\"\\nIn December, Musk tweeted that \"the danger of training AI to be woke — in other words, lie — is deadly.\"\\nMoskovitz has helped craft a 12-point list of possible policy changes for U.S. lawmakers to consider.\\n\"The thing I\\'m most interested in is making sure that state-of-the-art later generations, like GPT-5, GPT-6, get run through safety evaluations before being released into the world,\" he said. \"I think that will require regulation to coordinate all the players.\"\\nHe even made up a word, in a tweet last month, to express his convoluted views.\\n\"Excito-nervous for AI!\" he wrote.\\nCorrection: This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to the founders of Anthropic.\\nWATCH: Elon Musk creates A.I. startup called X.AI to take on OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'It happened so fast that Craig Mermel missed it.\\xa0\\nHe was standing in a busy operating room in West Virginia, waiting for a surgeon to place Precision Neuroscience\\'s neural implant system onto a conscious patient\\'s brain for the first time. Mermel, the president and chief product officer at Precision, said he looked away for a moment, and by the time he turned back, the company\\'s paper-thin electrode array was in position.\\xa0\\nIn seconds, a real-time, high-resolution rendering of the patient\\'s brain activity washed over a screen. According to Precision, the system had provided the highest resolution picture of human thought ever recorded.\\xa0\\n\"It was incredibly surreal,\" Mermel said in an interview with CNBC. \"The nature of the data and our ability to visualize that, you know, I got … chills.\"\\nThe procedure Mermel observed was the company\\'s first-ever in-human clinical study.\\nFounded in 2021 by a co-founder of Neuralink, Elon Musk\\'s brain-computer interface startup, Precision is an industry competitor working to help patients with paralysis operate digital devices by decoding their neural signals. A BCI is a system that deciphers brain signals and translates them into commands for external technologies, and several companies such as Synchron, Paradromics and Blackrock Neurotech have also created devices with this capability.\\xa0Precision announced a $41 million Series B funding round in January.\\nThe company\\'s flagship BCI system, the Layer 7 Cortical Interface, is an electrode array resembling a piece of scotch tape. Since it\\'s thinner than a human hair, Precision says it can conform to the brain\\'s surface without damaging any tissue, and in the study, Precision\\'s system was temporarily placed onto the brains of three patients who were already undergoing neurosurgery to have tumors removed.\\xa0\\nSince the technology worked as expected, future studies will explore further applications in clinical and behavioral contexts, Mermel said. If the trials go according to Precision\\'s plan, patients with severe degenerative diseases such as ALS could eventually regain some ability to communicate with loved ones by moving cursors, typing and even accessing social media with their minds.\\nAlthough an in-human study is a major milestone, the road to market for this type of technology is a long one. Precision has not yet received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for its device, and the company will have to work closely with regulators to successfully conduct several extremely thorough rounds of testing and data safety collection.\\nAs of June, no BCI company has managed to clinch the FDA\\'s final seal of approval.\\n\"The goal is to deliver a device that can help people living with permanent disability, so this is like the first step,\" Mermel said. \"Now the real work begins.\"\\nSeveral different academic medical centers offered to support the company\\'s pilot clinical study, according to Dr. Benjamin Rapoport, co-founder and chief science officer at Precision. The company partnered with West Virginia University\\'s Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute, and the two organizations prepared for the procedures for more than a year in advance, Rapoport said.\\nRapoport, who has been working on BCI technology for more than 20 years, said seeing Precision\\'s technology on the brain of a human patient for the first time was an \"incredibly gratifying\" milestone.\\n\"I can\\'t really describe emotionally what that\\'s like,\" he said. \"It was tremendous.\"\\nDr. Peter Konrad, chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery at the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute, was the surgeon who physically placed Precision\\'s system onto the patients\\' brains during their procedures.\\nKonrad said it was a simple process that felt like laying a piece of tissue paper on the brain.\\xa0\\nPatients had Precision\\'s system on their brains for 15 minutes. One of them remained asleep during the procedure, but two patients were woken up so the Layer 7 could capture their brain activity as they spoke.\\xa0\\n\"I\\'ve never seen that amount of data, 1,000 channels in real-time, of electrical activity, just washing over the brain as somebody was talking,\" Konrad said in an interview with CNBC. \"It was literally like you\\'re watching somebody think. It\\'s pretty amazing.\"\\nElectrodes are already used in practice to help neurosurgeons monitor brain activity during a procedure, but the resolution provided by conventional systems is low. Konrad said standard electrodes are about 4 mm big, while Precision\\'s array can put 500 to 1,000 contacts on that size.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\"It\\'s the difference between looking at the world with an old black and white camera versus seeing in hi-def,\" he said.\\nKonrad said it is too early for the patients in this study to see the direct benefits of this technology.\\nPrecision ultimately hopes its technology will not require open brain surgery at all. In an interview with CNBC in January, co-founder and CEO Michael Mager said a surgeon should be able to implant the array by making a thin slit in the skull and sliding in the device like a letter into a letter box. The slit would be less than a millimeter thick, so small that patients don\\'t need their hair shaved for the procedure.\\xa0\\nPrecision\\'s minimally invasive approach is intentional, as competing BCI companies such as Paradromics and Neuralink have designed systems meant to be inserted directly into the brain tissue.\\xa0\\nRapoport said inserting a BCI into the brain would provide a clear picture of what each neuron is doing, but it risks damaging the tissue and is difficult to scale. He said that level of detail is not necessary to decode speech or achieve the other functions Precision is striving for, so it was a trade-off the company was ultimately willing to make.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn the coming weeks, Precision will carry out the same procedure with two more patients as part of its pilot clinical study. Rapoport said the company has submitted its initial results to a scientific journal, and that having the data publicly available will be a \"huge next step.\"\\nPrecision also has similar studies in the works with health systems such as Mount Sinai in New York City and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and Rapoport said Precision is hoping to receive full FDA clearance for its first-generation device next year.\\xa0\\n\"The early results for us are tremendously gratifying to see,\" Rapoport said. \"If you\\'re lucky, there\\'s a few times in your life when you get to sort of see something before anybody else sees it in the world.\"\\n',\n",

Previous comments from Powell pointed to a possibility of the rises coming at alternate meetings, though he said Wednesday that might not be the case depending on how the data come in.\\nThe Fed hiked at each meeting since March 2022, a span that included four straight three-quarter point moves, before taking a break in June.\\n\"I wouldn\\'t take, you know, moving at consecutive meetings off the table,\" he said during an exchange moderated by CNBC\\'s Sara Eisen. The question-and-answer session took place at a forum sponsored by the European Central Bank.\\nMarkets took a modest hit as Powell spoke, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off more than 120 points.\\nCentral to the Fed\\'s current thinking is the belief that the 10 straight rate hikes haven\\'t had time to work their way through the economy. Therefore, officials can\\'t be sure whether policy meets the \"sufficiently restrictive\" standard to bring inflation down to the Fed\\'s 2% target.\\nMost economists think the rate increases ultimately will pull the U.S. into at least a shallow recession.\\n\"There\\'s a significant possibility that there will be a downturn,\" Powell said, adding that it\\'s not \"the most likely case, but it\\'s certainly possible.\"\\nAsked about banking stresses, Powell said the issues in March that led to the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and two other institutions did weigh into this thinking at the last meeting.\\nThough Powell repeatedly has stressed that he considers the general state of the U.S. banking industry to be solid, he said the Fed needs to be mindful that there could be some issues with credit availability. Recent surveys have shown a general tightening in standards and declining demand for loans.\\n\"Bank credit availability and credit can move down a little bit with a bit of a lag. So we\\'re watching carefully to see whether that does appear,\" he said.\\nPowell\\'s fellow central bankers at the forum also spoke forcefully about needing to control inflation.\\nECB President Christine Lagarde said she feels \"we still have ground to cover\" and thinks \"we will very likely hike again in July.\" Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said his institution could tighten its ultra-loose policy if inflation doesn\\'t ease up, while Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey stressed the importance of bringing down prices and said he wouldn\\'t consider raising the 2% inflation target.\\n\"It\\'s going to take some time. Inflation has proven to be more persistent than we expected and not less,\" Powell said. \"Of course, if that day comes when that turns around, that\\'ll be great. But we don\\'t expect that.\"\\n',\n",

More than 500,000 physicians and 306 million patients across the globe use Epic\\'s offerings, and the company has long-standing partnerships with both Microsoft and Nuance.\\xa0\\nThe companies are collaborating to build a system that can carry out many of clinicians\\' back-end administrative responsibilities. Nuance told CNBC on Tuesday that integrating its latest solution, Dragon Ambient eXperience Express, into Epic is a \"major step\" toward that goal.\\xa0\\nDAX Express automatically generates a draft clinical note within seconds after a patient visit. It can record a conversation between a doctor and a patient in real time and create a note using a combination of existing AI and OpenAI\\'s newest model, GPT-4.\\n\"I think the magical thing here is that note is produced not in an hour, but in a matter of seconds,\" Garrett Adams, product lead for Epic\\'s ambulatory division, told CNBC in an interview Tuesday. \"So whereas it would have taken them so much longer than that to type it out manually, they now get it better, faster and with a level of convenience that wasn\\'t even really possible to imagine a decade ago.\"\\nNuance, which Microsoft acquired for about $16 billion in 2021, sells tools for recognizing and transcribing speech during doctor\\'s office visits, customer service calls and voicemails.\\xa0The company first announced its DAX Express solution in March, and said in a release Tuesday that the technology is saving clinicians about seven minutes per patient encounter.\\nMany doctors and nurses across the U.S. are struggling to keep up with burdensome clerical work, so this time is a valuable commodity in the health-care industry.\\nA study funded by the American Medical Association in 2016 found that for every hour a physician spent with a patient, doctors spent an additional two hours on administrative tasks. The study said physicians also tend to spend an additional one to two hours doing clerical work outside of working hours, in what many refer to as \"pajama time.\"\\n\"The last thing they want to do is pajama time,\" Peter Durlach, chief strategy officer at Nuance told CNBC in an interview Tuesday. Adams added that Nuance\\'s technology will also allow physicians to be more present while they are meeting with patients.\\n\"The provider is able to sit and really focus on what the patient is saying, without thinking about all of the other things in the back of their mind that they need to keep track of,\" he said. \"The patient feels a lot more connected, a lot more listened to.\"\\nNuance has strict data agreements with its customers, so patient data is fully encrypted and runs in HIPAA-compliant environments.\\nDAX Express for Epic will be available in a private preview capacity for select users this summer, and Durlach said the company hopes to expand to general availability in the first quarter of 2024.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nLONDON — Google is having productive early conversations with regulators in the European Union about the bloc\\'s groundbreaking artificial intelligence regulations and how it and other companies can build AI safely and responsibly, the head of the company\\'s cloud computing division told CNBC.\\nThe internet search pioneer is working on tools to address a number of the bloc\\'s worries surrounding AI — including the concern it may become harder to distinguish between content that\\'s been generated by humans and that which has been produced by AI.\\n\"We\\'re having productive conversations with the EU government. Because we do want to find a path forward,\" Thomas Kurian said in an interview, speaking with CNBC exclusively from the company\\'s office in London.\\n\"These technologies have risk, but they also have enormous capability that generate true value for people.\"\\nKurian said that Google is working on technologies to ensure that people can distinguish between human and AI generated content. The company unveiled a \"watermarking\" solution that labels AI-generated images at its I/O event last month.\\nIt hints at how Google and other major tech companies are working on means of bringing private sector-driven oversight to AI ahead of formal regulations on the technology.\\nAI systems are evolving at a breakneck pace, with tools like ChatGPT and Stability Diffusion able to produce things that extend beyond the possibilities of past iterations of the technology. ChatGPT and tools like it are increasingly being used by computer programmers as companions to help them generate code, for example.\\nA key concern from EU policymakers and regulators further afield, though, is that generative AI models have lowered the barrier to mass production of content based on copyright-infringing material, and could harm artists and other creative professionals who rely on royalties to make money. Generative AI models are trained on huge sets of publicly available internet data, much of which is copyright-protected.\\nEarlier this month, members of the European Parliament approved legislation aimed at bringing oversight to AI deployment in the bloc. The law, known as the EU AI Act, includes provisions to ensure the training data for generative AI tools doesn\\'t violate copyright laws.\\n\"We have lots of European customers building generative AI apps using our platform,\" Kurian said. \"We continue to work with the EU government to make sure that we understand their concerns.\"\\xa0\\n\"We are providing tools, for example, to recognize if the content was generated by a model. And that is equally important as saying copyright is important, because if you can\\'t tell what was generated by a human or what was generated by a model, you wouldn\\'t be able to enforce it.\"\\nAI has become a key battleground in the global tech industry as companies compete for a leading role in developing the technology — particularly generative AI, which can generate new content from user prompts. What generative AI is capable of, from producing music lyrics to generating code, has wowed academics and boardrooms.\\xa0\\nBut it has also led to worries around job displacement, misinformation, and bias.\\nSeveral top researchers and employees within Google\\'s own ranks have expressed concern with how quickly the pace of AI is moving.\\xa0\\nGoogle employees dubbed the company\\'s announcement of Bard, its generative AI chatbot to rival Microsoft-backed OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT, as \"rushed,\" \"botched,\" and \"un-Googley\" in messages on the internal forum Memegen, for example.\\xa0\\nSeveral former high-profile researchers at Google have also sounded the alarm on the company\\'s handling of AI and what they say is a lack of attention to the ethical development of such technology.\\xa0\\nThey include Timnit Gebru, the former co-lead of Google\\'s ethical AI team, after raising alarm about the company\\'s internal guidelines on AI ethics, and Geoffrey Hinton, the machine learning pioneer known as the \"Godfather of AI,\" who left the company recently due to concerns its aggressive push into AI was getting out of control.\\nTo that end, Google\\'s Kurian wants global regulators to know it\\'s not afraid of welcoming regulation.\\n\"We have said quite widely that we welcome regulation,\" Kurian told CNBC. \"We do think these technologies are powerful enough, they need to be regulated in a responsible way, and we are working with governments in the European Union, United Kingdom and in many other countries to ensure they are adopted in the right way.\"\\nElsewhere in the global rush to regulate AI, the U.K. has introduced a framework of AI principles for regulators to enforce themselves rather than write into law its own formal regulations. Stateside, President Joe Biden\\'s administration and various U.S. government agencies have also proposed frameworks for regulating AI.\\nThe key gripe among tech industry insiders, however, is that regulators aren\\'t the fastest movers when it comes to responding to innovative new technologies. This is why many companies are coming up with their own approaches for introducing guardrails around AI, instead of waiting for proper laws to come through.\\nWATCH: A.I. is not in a hype cycle, it\\'s \\'transformational technology,\\' says Wedbush Securities\\' Dan Ives\\n',\n",

A reading above 50 marks an expansion in activity, while one below 50 marks a contraction.\\n\"Eurozone business output growth came close to stalling in June, according to the latest HCOB flash PMI survey data produced by S&P Global, pointing to renewed weakness in the economy after the brief growth revival recorded in the spring,\" S&P Global said in a release.\\n\"Although energy and supply chain worries have eased since late last year, June has seen a further escalation of concerns over demand growth, and in particular the impact of higher interest rates, and the resulting possibilities of recessions both in domestic markets and further afield.\"\\nSpeaking to CNBC\\'s Street Signs Europe, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, described the numbers as \"worrying.\"\\n\"Higher interest rates, the rise in the cost of living, all beginning to take their toll,\" he said.\\nThe European Central Bank has been increasing interest rates consistently for the past 12 months in an effort to bring down inflation. Higher rates can lead to higher costs for companies across the bloc, however, and so often become a drag on output.\\nOn a country-by-country basis, data earlier in the day from Germany also showed a slowdown in Europe\\'s largest economy. The German flash composite PMIs fell to 50.8 in June from 53.9 in May. This was below market expectations.\\n\"These data are consistent with our view that GDP (gross domestic product) growth in Germany will remain subdued in second and third quarters after the economy registered a technical recession,\" Claus Vistesen, chief euro zone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients.\\nGermany entered a technical recession in the first quarter of the year, after contracting 0.3% over the three-month period. In the final quarter of 2022, Germany\\'s economy shrunk by 0.5%.\\nIt was a similar story in France, where the composite PMI sunk to 47.3 from 51.2 in May, well below the 51 expected.

It makes memory chips that go into data centers and laptops.\\nBut Samsung also has a chip manufacturing business known as a foundry, which produces semiconductors for other companies that design chips, such as Qualcomm.\\nEarlier this year, Samsung said it would begin making chips with a 2-nanometer process in 2025. The company has now given a more detailed road map, saying it\\xa0will begin mass production of the 2-nm process for mobile applications in 2025, then expand to high-performance computing in 2026 and to automotive in 2027.\\nThe nanometer figure refers to the size of each individual transistor on a chip. The smaller the transistor, the more of them can be packed onto a single semiconductor. Typically, a reduction in nanometer size can yield more powerful and efficient chips.\\nFor reference, Apple's latest iPhone processor is made using a 5-nm process. Samsung anticipates that smartphones will require more advanced chips moving forward and is preparing for that in 2025.\\nHigh-performance computing refers to chips for data centers to train and deploy artificial intelligence applications, as Samsung looks to capitalize on the growth of the technology, partly spurred by the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Nvidia, a market leader in AI chips, relies on foundries like TSMC to manufacture its semiconductors.\\nSamsung's foundry lags Taiwan's TSMC, the world's biggest contract manufacturer, by some distance. In the first quarter of the year, TSMC accounted for 59% of global semiconductor foundry revenue, versus 13% for Samsung, according to Counterpoint Research.\\nSamsung is now looking to play catch-up by upping its capacity and laying a road map out for high-growth areas in the chip market.\\nThe company reiterated that its 1.4-nm process will begin in 2027 as planned.\\nSamsung also said it is continuing to expand its chip manufacturing capacity, with new manufacturing lines in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, and Taylor, Texas, which Samsung has previously announced.\\n\",\n",

Companies that are either in need of more liquidity or those that already have hefty debt loads in need of refinancing are faced with a high cost of new debt.\\nThe options often include distressed exchanges, which is when a company swaps its debt for another form of debt or repurchases the debt. Or, in dire circumstances, a restructuring may take place in or out of court.\\n\"Capital is much more expensive now,\" said Mohsin Meghji, founding partner of restructuring and advisory firm M3 Partners. \"Look at the cost of debt. You could reasonably get debt financing for 4% to 6% at any point on average over the last 15 years. Now that cost of debt has gone up to 9% to 13%.\"\\nMeghji added that his firm has been particularly busy since the fourth quarter across numerous industries. While the most troubled companies have been affected recently, he expects companies with more financial stability to have issues refinancing due to high interest rates.\\nThrough June 22, there were 324 bankruptcy filings, not far behind the total of 374 in 2022, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. There were more than 230 bankruptcy filings through April of this year, the highest rate for that period since 2010.\\nEnvision Healthcare, a provider of emergency medical services, was the biggest default in May. It had more than $7 billion in debt when it filed for bankruptcy, according to Moody\\'s.\\nHome security and alarm company Monitronics International, regional financial institution Silicon Valley Bank, retail chain Bed Bath & Beyond and regional sports network owner Diamond Sports are also among the largest bankruptcy filings so far this year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\\nIn many cases, these defaults are months, if not quarters, in the making, said Tero Jänne, co-head of capital transformation and debt advisory at investment bank Solomon Partners.\\n\"The default rate is a lagging indicator of distress,\" Jänne said. \"A lot of times those defaults don\\'t occur until well past a number of initiatives to address the balance sheet, and it\\'s not until a bankruptcy you see that capital D default come into play.\"\\nMoody\\'s expects the global default rate to rise to 4.6% by the end of the year, higher than the long-term average of 4.1%. That rate is projected to rise to 5% by April 2024 before beginning to ease.\\nIt\\'s safe to bet there will be more defaults, said Mark Hootnick, also co-head of capital transformation and debt advisory at Solomon Partners. Until now, \"we\\'ve been in an environment of incredibly lax credit, where, frankly, companies that shouldn\\'t be tapping the debt markets have been able to do so without limitations.\"\\nThis is likely why defaults have occurred across various industries. There were some industry-specific reasons, too.\\n\"It\\'s not like one particular sector has had a lot of defaults,\" said Sharon Ou, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody\\'s. \"Instead it\\'s quite a number of defaults in different industries. It depends on leverage and liquidity.\"\\nIn addition to big debt loads, Envision was toppled by health-care issues stemming from the pandemic, Bed Bath & Beyond suffered from having a large store footprint while many customers opted for shopping online, and Diamond Sports was hurt by the rise of consumers dropping cable TV packages.\\n\"We all know the risks facing companies right now, such as weakening economic growth, high interest rates and high inflation,\" Ou said. \"Cyclical sectors will be affected, such as durable consumers goods, if people cut back on spending.\"\\n',\n",

So-called core PCE increased 4.6% from a year ago, 0.1 percentage point less than expected.\\nIn April, the index rose 0.4% for the month and 4.7% from a year ago.\\nWhen including the volatile food and energy components, inflation was considerably softer — up just 0.1% on the month and 3.8% from a year ago. Those were down respectively from the 0.4% and 4.3% increases reported for April. The headline year-over-year number was the lowest since April 2021 while the core was the lowest since October 2021.\\nWhile inflation pulled back a bit, spending rose just 0.1% for the month, below the 0.2% estimate and a sharp drop from the 0.6% increase in April. That deceleration came even though personal income accelerated 0.4%, ahead of the 0.3% estimate.\\n\"The spending splurge is likely nearing the end as consumers released most of the pent-up demand for spending,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial.\\nThough Friday\\'s data showed inflation moving gradually in the right direction, it is still well above the Fed\\'s 2% longer-term target. Central bank Chairman Jerome Powell said this week that level isn\\'t likely to be achieved for a few years yet.\\nAt their meeting earlier in June, Fed officials indicated they expect at least two more quarter-point interest rate hikes before the end of the year.

This was the third and final estimate for Q1 GDP. The growth rate was 2.6% in the fourth quarter.\\nThe upward revision helps undercut widespread expectations that the U.S. is heading toward a recession. A separate economic report released Thursday showed layoffs running well below expectations, indicating that labor market strength has held up even in the face of the Federal Reserve\\'s 10 interest rate hikes totaling 5 percentage points.\\nAccording to a summary from the department\\'s Bureau of Economic Analysis, the change came in large part because both consumer expenditures and exports were stronger than previously thought.\\nConsumer spending, as gauged by personal consumption expenditures, rose 4.2%, the highest quarterly pace since the second quarter of 2021. At the same time, exports rose 7.8% after falling 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nAn 8.7% boost in the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment likely boosted the consumer spending numbers, said Scott Hoyt, senior director at Moody\\'s Analytics.\\n\"Overall, however, the economy remains admirably resilient, and odds of a recession beginning this year are receding. But the coast is far from clear,\" he said.\\nThere also was some good news on the inflation front.\\nCore PCE prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 4.9% in the period, a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point. The all-times price index increased 3.8%, unchanged from the last estimate.\\nFederal Reserve policymakers most closely watch core PCE as an inflation indicator. Through a series of rate increases, the Fed is trying to get inflation back down to 2%.\\nThe rate hikes are targeted at slowing down an economy that in the summer of 2022 was generating inflation at the highest level since the early 1980s.\\nOne specific focus for the Fed has been the labor market. There currently are about 1.7 open positions for every available worker, and the tightness has resulted in a push higher for wages which generally have not kept pace with inflation.\\n\"Obviously, while the baseline forecast calls for the economy to skirt recession, risks are extremely high. It would take little to push the economy into recession,\" Hoyt said.\\nA separate report Thursday from the Labor Department pointed showed that initial jobless claims fell to 239,000 for the week ended June 24.

       "    'content': 'The U.S. will enter a downturn in the fourth quarter, followed by a \"year of contraction and a European recession in 2024,\" according to HSBC Asset Management.\\nIn its midyear outlook, the British banking giant\\'s asset manager said recession warnings are \"flashing red\" for many economies, while fiscal and monetary policies are out of sync with stock and bond markets.\\nJoseph Little, global chief strategist at HSBC Asset Management, said while some parts of the economy have remained resilient thus far, the balance of risks \"points to high recession risk now,\" with Europe lagging the U.S. but the macro trajectory generally \"aligned.\"\\n\"We are already in a mild profit recession, and corporate defaults have started to creep up too,\" Little said in the report seen by CNBC.\\n\"The silver lining is that we expect high inflation to moderate relatively quickly. That will create an opportunity for policymakers to cut rates.\"\\nDespite the hawkish tone adopted by central bankers and the apparent stickiness of inflation, particularly at the core level, HSBC Asset Management expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates before the end of 2023, with the European Central Bank and the Bank of England following suit next year.\\nThe Fed paused its monetary tightening cycle at its June meeting, leaving its fed funds rate target range at between 5% and 5.25%, but signaled that two further hikes can be expected this year. Market pricing narrowly anticipates the fed funds rates to be a quarter percentage point higher in December of this year, according to CME Group\\'s FedWatch tool.\\nHSBC\\'s Little acknowledged that central bankers will not be able to cut rates if inflation remains significantly above target — as it is in many major economies — and said it is therefore important that the recession \"doesn\\'t come too early\" and cause disinflation.\\n\"The coming recession scenario will be more like the early 1990s recession, with our central scenario being a 1-2% drawdown in GDP,\" Little added.\\nHSBC expects the recession in Western economies to result in a \"difficult, choppy outlook for markets\" for two reasons.\\n\"First, we have the rapid tightening of financial conditions that\\'s caused a downturn in the credit cycle. Second, markets do not appear to be pricing a particularly pessimistic view of the world,\" Little said.\\n\"We think the incoming news flow over the next six months could be tough to digest for a market that\\'s pricing a \\'soft landing.\\'\"\\nLittle suggested that this recession will not be sufficient to \"purge\" all inflation pressures from the system, and therefore developed economies face a regime of \"somewhat higher inflation and interest rates over time.\"\\n\"As a result, we take a cautious overall view on risk and cyclicality in portfolios. Interest rate exposure is appealing — particularly the Treasury curve — the front end and mid part of the curve,\" Little said, adding that the firm sees \"some value\" in European bonds, too.\\n\"In credit, we are selective and focus on higher quality credits in investment grade over speculative investment grade credits. We are cautious on developed market stocks.\"\\nAs China emerges from several years of stringent Covid-19 lockdown measures, HSBC believes that high levels of domestic household savings should continue to support domestic demand, while problems in the property sector are bottoming out and government fiscal efforts should create jobs.\\nLittle also suggested that comparatively low inflation — consumer prices rose by a two-year monthly low of 0.1% in May as the economy struggles to get back to firing on all cylinders — means further monetary policy easing is possible and GDP growth \"should easily exceed\" the government\\'s modest 5% target this year.\\nHSBC remains overweight on Chinese stocks for this reason, and Little said the \"diversification of Chinese equities shouldn\\'t be underestimated.\"\\n\"For example, value is outperforming growth in China and Asia. That\\'s the opposite of developed stock markets,\" he added.\\nAlong with China, Little noted that India is the \"main macro growth story in 2023\" as the economy has recovered strongly from the pandemic on the back of resurgent consumer spending and a robust services sector.\\n\"In India, recent upward growth surprises and downward surprises on inflation are creating something of a \\'Goldilocks\\' economic mix,\" Little said.\\n\"Improved corporate and bank balance sheets have also been boosted by government subsidies. All the while, the structural, long run investment story for India remains intact.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Persistent inflation and higher interest rates have strained many household budgets, and consumers are shying away from some purchases such as home improvement projects or apparel. But millions of U.S. consumers aren\\'t giving up their vacations.\\nA Deloitte survey from last month found that 50% of respondents planned to take a vacation that includes paid lodging during the summer, up from 46% last year. In a sign of strong demand, the Transportation Security Administration screened close to 10 million people over Memorial Day weekend, slightly more than the same period in pre-pandemic 2019. And American Airlines this week raised its adjusted earnings forecast for this quarter, thanks to strong demand and cheaper fuel.\\nMany travelers are seeing some relief when they book airline tickets or fill up the tank before a road trip, at least compared with last year.\\nPrices for airline tickets, for example, were down 0.9% in April from a year ago, according to the latest federal inflation read.\\nAnd yet, consumer spending has begun moderating overall but \"the categories that are holding up the strongest are the travel categories,\" said Jason Gaughan, head of consumer credit card products at Bank of America.\\nPrices vary wildly depending where travelers are planning to go. A round-trip domestic flight is averaging $306 this summer, down 19% from last year, though still 6% higher than in 2019, according to travel site Hopper.\\nCapacity constraints due to shortages of aircraft and pilots have affected airline growth and kept fares elevated for months.\\nInternational travel has roared back this year as countries around the world lift pandemic restrictions. But there\\'s still plenty of demand for domestic destinations that dominated travel during the pandemic. That\\'s especially true because airlines have ramped up capacity to Europe and other international destinations, but bargains are hard to find during the peak late spring and summer months.\\nAirfare to Europe is averaging $1,167 round trip this summer, up 36% from last year, Hopper data showed.\\nLodging also has been more expensive this year, even within the U.S. Hotel occupancy averaged 60.6% from January though April, with per-night average rates of $152.68, according to hotel data firm STR. That\\'s up from 63% occupancy and average nightly rates of $130.05 during the same period in 2019, and up from 58.4% occupancy and average rates of $141 a night last year.\\nBut there are vast differences between some destinations because of changing travel patterns. Nightly hotel rates for Maui, Hawaii, have increased more than 53% since 2019 to $535.90, the biggest percentage increase in the U.S., according to STR. Meanwhile, hotel rates in the San Jose and Santa Cruz areas of California are down nearly 17% from 2019 to $171.52 as business travel in tech and other sectors still hasn\\'t recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\\nConsumers looking to save money on travel need to be flexible. Travel experts suggest booking outside of traditional peak periods, like during shoulder season in the fall, though there are trade-offs, such as the possibility for worse weather.\\nKobe Guerrero, a Caribbean travel specialist at Raleigh, North Carolina-based agency Trip and Sip Travel, said some customers could find cheaper rates and fares booking in September or October for the northern Caribbean, but that it comes with a risk.\\n\"But then you might have a hurricane ruin your whole vacation,\" Guerrero said. She said she would require the buyers to get travel insurance.\\xa0\\nSome travelers are also trying to prepare by booking far ahead.\\n\"Luxury resorts are getting booked two years in advance,\" Guerrero said.\\nOthers are giving up some spending elsewhere to pay for trips.\\nPervez Virani, an IT project manager, said he and his wife, Zoha Karmali, a property manager, used American Airlines frequent flyer miles to visit New York City over Memorial Day weekend but that they saved money by returning on Wednesday instead of at the end of the weekend.\\nVirani said the couple had been cooking dinner at home to save on dining out before their trip with their 10-year-old Yorkie, Jordan.\\n\"We\\'re cutting costs at home,\" he said.\\n',\n",

All the fountains are taped off with plastic bags. Bottles of water are stacked nearby. A water filtration system is set to be installed over the summer.\\xa0\\n\"We\\'re very concerned,\" Hermon School District Superintendent Micah Grant told CNBC.\\xa0\\nThe reason? The school\\'s water recently tested above the state\\'s safety limit for PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl\\xa0substances, often referred to as \"forever chemicals.\"\\xa0\\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, even tiny exposure to PFAS in drinking water could pose a serious health risk.\\xa0\\n\"We\\'re not fully understanding why it\\'s in our water and it\\'s at the level we\\'re at,\" Grant said.\\nHermon High School is just one example of PFAS contamination currently affecting the community, according to Maine\\'s attorney general, Aaron Frey. The chemicals have also been identified in groundwater in towns and municipalities throughout the state including several military facilities and farms, according to Frey.\\n\"There are farmers who had to euthanize their livestock because of the chemical contamination,\" Frey told CNBC.\\xa0\\nMaine recently joined a growing list of states — which now includes New Mexico, Maryland, and Rhode Island — in filing litigation against several chemical manufacturers claiming they have caused significant harm to the state\\'s residents and natural resources.\\n\"We\\'re alleging that 3M and DuPont [and other manufacturers] created these chemicals ... had the science that showed just how dangerous they were, how toxic they were, how they were going to last forever,\" Frey said. \"It is my responsibility to do whatever I can to hold accountable those companies that profited off of this chemical.\"\\nMore than a dozen other states — including Alaska, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Vermont and Wisconsin — have filed litigation against PFAS manufacturers over the years.\\nSome have already reached settlements. Minnesota, for example, settled with 3M for $850 million, and Delaware settled with DuPont and its spinoffs for $50 million, resolving the companies\\' responsibility for damage in those states.\\nWall Street is now awaiting a bellwether trial in federal court, set to begin Monday, in which the city of Stuart, Florida, alleges that firefighting foam chemicals manufactured by 3M contaminated its water supply.\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, PFAS are a group of chemicals used to make coatings and products that resist heat, oil, stains, grease and water.\\nThe human-made substances date back to the 1940s, and over the decades, they\\'ve been used in a wide range of applications, including nonstick cookware, waterproof fabrics, carpeting, food packaging and cosmetics in addition to firefighting foam like that at the center of the lawsuit in Stuart.\\nBut over time, concerns began to rise. CDC officials say the synthetic chemicals do not break down in the environment and are tied to serious health risks.\\n\"We\\'ve seen correlations with thyroid disease, certain kinds of cancer, kidney disease, liver dysfunction, it becomes concentrated in the liver ... they\\'re called \\'forever chemicals\\' because they stay in your body,\" former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC. \"I think what the government needs to do is step up testing, make sure that we have a better picture of where these chemicals are getting into food sources [and] in the water supply.\"\\nWhile testing of PFAS is expected to become more prevalent in the years to come, Gottlieb said there are steps consumers can take now to assess their exposure. Residents who live close to a military base or an industrial plant that is known for making these chemicals should ask their local water utility if it has tested PFAS levels, he said.\\n\"There was a big analysis done a number of years ago of different water municipalities that found that about 1% of all municipal water sources did contain some level of PFAS,\" Gottlieb said.\\nMore than 64 million people are affected by drinking water contaminated with PFAS — represented by a reading of 4 parts per trillion or above — according to an EPA report released in March.\\nSeveral manufacturers have announced plans to reduce or discontinue the production of PFAS in the coming years.\\xa0\\n\"As the science and technology of PFAS, societal and regulatory expectations, and our expectations of ourselves have evolved, so has how we manage PFAS,\" a 3M spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC, adding the company plans to end production of the chemicals by 2025.\\nThe company also expressed a commitment to remediate PFAS contamination, invest in water treatment and collaborate with communities.\\xa0\\nDuPont, on the other hand, said it has \"never manufactured\" the harmful chemicals and believes the legal complaints are \"without merit.\"\\nThe company, formerly E.I. du Pont de Nemours, separated its chemical businesses in 2015, forming Chemours Company. It then merged with Dow in 2017 to create DowDuPont, and then subsequently split into three separate entities in 2019: Corteva Agriscience, Dow and the new DuPont.\\nAll these companies, along with others, are named as defendants in Maine\\'s lawsuit. DuPont and Chemours have been severed from the bellwether trial where the city of Stuart, Florida is the main plaintiff.\\nOn Friday, DuPont, Chemours and Corteva announced a $1.19 billion fund that will be used to resolve \"PFAS-related drinking water claims.\" However an addendum to a joint statement announcing the fund adds that it \"does not include claims of personal injury due to alleged exposure to PFAS or claims by State Attorneys General that alleged PFAS contamination has damaged the State\\'s natural resources.\"\\nChemours pledged in 2018 to reduce PFAS emissions at its manufacturing sites by at least 99% by 2030. A spokesperson said in a statement it has made significant progress in implementing advanced technologies to minimize emissions of fluorinated organic compounds.\\nDow denied manufacturing PFAS and said it is not accused of causing any environmental contamination.\\nA Corteva spokesperson told CNBC it \"does not comment on ongoing legal matters.\"\\nRBC Capital Markets Managing Director Deane Dray sees the lawsuits as a particular financial risk to 3M.\\n\"At this stage, given valuation and what we know about the PFAS litigation, we do consider 3M to be uninvestable at this point,\" Dray told CNBC.\\nShares of 3M have been under pressure this year, down 20% over the last six months, trading at their lowest level in over 10 years.\\n\"I expect PFAS to be a front-page news item for the next couple of years,\" Dray said, adding that the substances are used right now in many semiconductor applications and military weapons systems.\\nAccording to RBC Capital, 3M\\'s PFAS liability risk amounts to an estimated $20 billion to $25 billion.\\xa0\\n3M is showing signs it may be feeling the pressure: In its latest earnings report it revealed a restructuring plan that included layoffs affecting 6,000 employees around the world that the company says will save up to $900 million a year. It\\'s also planning to spin off its health-care business in early 2024, which analysts say will generate billions of dollars in capital.\\nThe industrial giant is already facing separate lawsuits over its military Combat Arms earplugs. Those suits are being brought by more than 200,000 military service members and veterans who claim 3M\\'s earplugs were defective and failed to protect them from hearing loss during combat and training.\\n3M attorney Eric Rucker told CNBC in March that the earplugs worked when used according to their instructions and that any liabilities estimate was \"purely speculative.\"\\nLast year, the Biden administration announced that $10 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law would be used toward addressing PFAS contamination.\\nThat same month, the EPA introduced for the first time new standards on drinking water that address the amount of PFAS allowable for consumption.\\nThe industry is awaiting word on whether the EPA will move forward with designating PFAS compounds as hazardous chemicals, which experts say could open the door to further litigation and push water utilities to make necessary upgrades to their filtration systems.\\nWhile the agency has publicly acknowledged its intent to do so, experts including Capstone energy analyst Gianna Kinsman says a formal designation could come by the end of this year.\\xa0\\nKinsman added that the 2024 presidential election could also influence the timeline: \"I think it is likely that if a Republican takes office we could see a slowdown in PFAS regulation, whereas if Biden wins a second term I believe his PFAS regulatory agenda will be even more ambitious, potentially tackling PFAS by larger categories rather than individually.\"\\nRBC\\'s Dray added that there is national security interest in extending the use of PFAS due to a lack of alternative options on the market.\\n\"[It will take] a decade to develop another molecule and then have all the testing done,\" he said.\\nIn the meantime, scientists and industrial experts are in an arms race to develop a safer substitute to PFAS. Others are researching technologies that use electrification and heat to break down synthetic chemicals as well as treatment options for exposed areas.\\nNearly 30 miles away from Hermon High School, in the rural farming town of Unity, Maine, sits the remnants of the once-thriving Songbird Farm.\\xa0\\nNine years ago, Adam Nordell — who\\'s now an advocate for nonprofit Defend Our Health — and his wife, Johanna Davis, came to this property to grow healthy and fresh produce to sell to their community.\\xa0\\nAt the time, Songbird was thriving and lush, and over the years the couple grew a mix of grains and vegetables, including tomatoes, peppers, garlic, onions, sweet potatoes and cantaloupe.\\xa0\\nBut that all changed two years ago when Nordell and Davis had their soil tested after a customer called about a local news report she saw detailing a farm contaminated with PFAS.\\xa0\\nWhen the test results came back, their worst fears were realized.\\n\"We learned our land was severely contaminated with forever chemicals,\" Nordell said. \"As soon as we learned, we shut down.\"\\nThe family has since learned the land was spread with municipal wastewater treatment sludge in the early 1990s. Nordell said at the time it was marketed to farmers as a free or cheap source of fertilization.\\n\"The farmers were told they were fertilizing their crops. Unfortunately, that wastewater is laden with all sorts of industrial chemicals that are leaching out of consumer products,\" he said.\\nThe mission of the nonprofit he now works for is to reduce people\\'s exposure to toxic chemicals, to raise awareness among farmers across the country and to hold chemical manufacturers accountable.\\n\"They need to step up to the plate and pay for the impact that they\\'ve had on the world,\" Nordell said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': \"The price to ship goods by air jumped to a record just before Christmas 2021, driven by strong e-commerce demand, port congestion and a chokehold on capacity from airlines' limited pandemic schedules.\\nThose trends also drove a boom in a small but lucrative corner of the aerospace industry: converting passenger planes into aircraft that can haul cargo. A record 164 planes were converted to freighters last year, according to aviation data firm Cirium.\\nAir cargo rates have since declined, in part from a flood of new capacity on the market from the resurgence in air travel. Air freight flies in the bellies of passenger planes and dedicated freighters, most of which are converted planes. The Baltic Air Freight Index was down more than 48% from last year.\\nBut companies such as Boeing have been ramping up capacity to convert planes as orders continue to come in.\\nAcross the globe, in facilities from Texas to Singapore, technicians rip out old seats, galleys, lavatories and other parts of the plane, leaving behind crumbs, children's toys and other signs of aircrafts' past lives carrying passengers.\\nTechnicians then reinforce the floor to carry heavy cargo loads, and a special doorway is cut and door installed so goods can be loaded onto the plane.\\nThe process can take months and cost millions of dollars, in some cases more than $30 million per plane, including maintenance. Companies that specialize in this business say they're still racking up orders to turn planes into freighters, despite the lower shipping rates.\\nCNBC visited Aspire MRO and Mammoth Freighters in Fort Worth, Texas — where the companies are converting Boeing 777 wide-body aircraft into giant cargo haulers — to see how the process works.\\nWatch the video to learn more.\\n\",\n",

They want to develop and produce this equipment in India — not just be a foreign purchaser,\" said Daniel Silverberg, managing director at Capstone and a former national security advisor.\\nThe potential GE deal comes as India\\'s economy has grown exponentially, drawing more interest from corporate giants like Apple, Google and Amazon. In May, Apple CEO Tim Cook traveled to India and met with Modi as the iPhone maker opened its first two big retail stores in the country.\\nThe emerging market is also increasingly seen as a way to counterbalance China\\'s dominance in broader Asia.\\n\"One policy objective of the U.S. administration is to strengthen the capacity of the Indian military to play a key role in the counter-China effort,\" said Silverberg.\\nGE Aerospace has been growing its presence in India for four decades, leveraging joint ventures to gain market share.\\n\"We certainly see a lot of activity brewing in India,\" GE CEO Larry Culp told CNBC in late April, weeks after Air India placed a massive order for more than 800 GE LEAP engines.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Long flights are making a comeback.\\nIt is one of the clearest signs yet that airlines are betting that the rebound of international travel, devastated in the Covid pandemic, will continue to grow.\\nOn Wednesday, Qantas launched service between New York and Sydney with a stop in Auckland, New Zealand, on Boeing 787 Dreamliners, instead of a previous stop in Los Angeles. But the Australian carrier is focusing on even longer routes: Nonstop flights from Sydney to New York and London. Flights could clock in at around 20 hours, enough time to watch most of the Star Wars Skywalker Saga.\\n\"You don\\'t have to take your bags off, you don\\'t have to transfer, you don\\'t have a chance of misconnecting,\" Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told CNBC on Thursday at a showcase of the airline\\'s new cabins in New York. The airline estimates the new routes could reduce travel time by more than three hours compared with flights with stops in other airports.\\nFor eight years, Qantas has been working with sleep scientists who have studied passenger moods, sleep patterns and food intake in hopes of limiting the impacts of jet lag on super-long flights, with test runs in 2019. They found that delaying meal service and keeping passengers awake longer with cabin lights help to fight the impacts of jet lag when they arrive at their destination.\\nQantas is planning to operate the new nonstops on ultra-long-range Airbus A350-1000 planes starting as soon as late 2025. They will seat 238 passengers, far fewer than the more than 350 passengers that standard versions of the planes can fit. Qantas limited the number of people on board to fit more spacious seating and to account for weight and the plane\\'s range.\\nThe airline has ordered 12 of the special planes.\\n\"Qantas is the only airline wanting to do this. Because from Australia, we\\'re so far away from everywhere that we can justify at least 12 [of these] aircraft,\" Joyce said.\\nThe planes will be outfitted with six enclosed, first-class suites that include a table for two, a reclining chair, a 32-inch touch-screen television and a 2-meter (more than 6.5-foot) flatbed. It will also have 52 business-class suites with lie-flat beds and 40 premium economy seats, as well as 140 seats in economy class.\\nThey will also have what Qantas calls a \"Wellbeing Zone\" that has handles for stretching, on-screen exercise guides and refreshments. Wi-Fi will be complimentary, Qantas said.\\nJoyce said the airline\\'s international capacity is back to 85% of pre-pandemic levels and that he expects that to fully recover next March.\\nYet even though ultra-long-haul flights are technically possible thanks to more efficient engines and aircraft, they face other challenges.\\n\"There\\'s technical feasibility, and then there\\'s economic feasibility,\" said Robert Mann, an\\xa0airline\\xa0industry analyst and former\\xa0airline\\xa0executive.\\nSingapore Airlines, for example, launched a nonstop flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Singapore that took about 18 hours (times vary due to winds and other factors) in 2004, a bet on business travel and that customers between the two destinations would pay to avoid connecting in another airport. In 2008, it offered reconfigured cabins that solely featured 100 business class seats on the A340-500.\\nBut it discontinued the flight in 2013 as the carrier got rid of the fuel-guzzling, four-engine aircraft. It relaunched it in 2018 with a mix of business-class and premium-economy seats, pausing it during the pandemic and relaunching it last year.\\nIn November 2020, the carrier introduced what is currently the world\\'s longest flight, from New York\\'s John F. Kennedy International Airport to Singapore.\\nHere is a look at the world\\'s longest flights by distance, according to airline data firm OAG:\\n',\n",

The question is whether Boeing, Airbus and their numerous suppliers can catch up.\\n\"That\\'s creating pressure on the order books — it\\'s creating upward momentum on used aircraft lease rates and forcing airlines to make compromises,\" said Andy Cronin, CEO of aircraft-leasing firm Avolon.\\nAviation analytics firm IBA estimated last week that there could be orders for about 2,100 planes during the show as airlines replace older aircraft and prepare for future growth in air travel.\\nOver the past year, Boeing has logged large orders or preliminary agreements from customers including United Airlines, Saudia and new Saudi carrier Riyadh Air. Air India\\'s massive order earlier this year included both Boeing and Airbus jets.\\nTurkish Airlines\\' chairman told reporters last month that the carrier is planning to order around 600 aircraft, both wide-body and narrow-body planes. The order would be the largest ever for a single airline, though it isn\\'t clear whether that would come together in time for the show.\\nIBA\\'s chief economist, Stuart Hatcher, wrote in a June 15 forecast that Delta Air Lines, Malaysia Airlines and Air France-KLM could be buyers, but the timing isn\\'t yet certain. Air Baltic could also look to expand its Airbus A220 fleet, he said.\\n\"It might still be too early to call any Chinese expansion yet given the political climate, but I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see top-up orders coming through,\" Hatcher wrote.\\nThe major challenge for manufacturers now is increasing production. Slots for narrow-body jets, such as Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s, are sold out for years. Now that long-haul travel is returning, some airlines could also be looking to expand their fleets of larger, long-range jets.\\nBut customers around the world have been forced to wait longer than expected for new planes as Boeing, Airbus and a web of suppliers around the world try to ramp up output. That has limited airline capacity, keeping airfares high.\\nQantas CEO Alan Joyce told CNBC last week that he expects supply chain issues to last into 2025.\\nBoeing and Airbus are scrambling to raise production rates for the coming years to meet that demand.\\nThe production delays have also driven up rates to lease both new and older planes as airlines search for other opportunities to boost flights.\\nNew Boeing 737 Max 8 planes are leasing for about $350,000 a month in July, up from $305,000 in January 2020 as the pandemic was beginning, IBA estimates. New Airbus 320s are going for $355,000, up from $325,000 over that period. Older versions are close to pre-pandemic levels.\\n\"People just want their jets,\" said Richard Aboulafia managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': \"At the midpoint of 2023, some investors see a recession storm on the horizon while others see clear skies ahead.\\nThe recession crowd is worried about negative consumer sentiment, while the no-recession camp is heartened by more-positive-than-expected data from the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey, released in June.\\nEconomic pessimists fret over corporate earnings, but optimists point out that an anticipated earnings apocalypse failed to arrive in the first quarter, when earnings beat expectations. The former worry about more Fed interest rate increases, while the latter point to declining inflation.\\nHere's a look at other stories impacting the financial advisor business.\\nRecessions haven't always resulted in declining stock markets, and good opportunities can be found amid them. Nevertheless, recessionary business environments generally aren't good for corporate earnings, and investors' perceptions are, of course, highly impactful.\\nInvestors convinced that a recession impacting the market is imminent continue to sit on cash. But some of them might be inclined to invest for the long term in sectors unlikely to suffer heavy damage from a receding economy.\\nHere's a midyear sector guide for both economic optimists and pessimists.\\nThe best sectors for recession disbelievers are the most economically sensitive ones: industrials, materials and financials.\\nIndustrials, which manufacture finished products for commercial and consumer use, recently have been picking up steam; SPDR Industrial Select Sector ETF XLI was up 8% over the three months that ended in mid-June.\\nIndustrial names with currently low downside risk and good growth potential include: Cintas, Fastenal, Westinghouse Air Brake Co., Cummins Inc., CSX, Emerson Electric, Otis Worldwide, Carrier, Caterpillar, Honeywell, Illinois Tool Works and Lockheed Martin Corp.\\nMaterials companies, an opaque sector to most individual investors, comprise five industry groups: metals and mining, chemicals, containers and packaging, construction materials, and paper/forest products. Materials are what industrial companies use to make products so, without them, nothing gets built. This is a small sector, but its output directly affects all the others.\\nAfter a rough 2023 thus far, materials stock prices are rock-bottom low, having lagged over the last 12 months (-9% versus +4% for the S&P 500 Index). Well-positioned companies with good growth prospects currently include: Corteva, Dow Chemical, Ecolab, Linde plc, Martin Marietta Materials, Nucor Corp., PPG Industries and Sherwin-Williams.\\nBoth industrials and materials will likely get a boost over the next couple of years from the nascent trend of reshoring or onshoring. Those terms refer to American manufacturers seeking to relocate their plants in other countries to American soil to avoid supply-chain disruptions from shutdowns and shipping bottlenecks like those of the pandemic.\\nAnother tailwind for these two sectors, especially materials, is the trillions of dollars in incentives available from recently passed congressional legislation to spur capital investment in domestic infrastructure, clean energy and technology. These initiatives will spur industrial growth and increase the use of materials for construction and green manufacturing.\\nThe most economically sensitive sector may be financials. As of mid-June, SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF was down about 2.16% year to date but up 7.73% for the preceding three months.\\nThis growth has come as regional-bank fears have abated and investor confidence in banks has increased. This confidence reflects industry strength related to higher capital reserves, required since the financial crisis of 2008.\\nNet operating income is at an all-time high, and the sector is trading at an average price-earnings ratio of about 8.5 — well below its three-year average of 12.1. And insurance companies, which have much of their treasure in bonds, are benefiting substantially from highly elevated bond yields.\\nNames positioned for likely growth over the next year or two include: Aflac, JPMorgan Chase, T. Rowe Price Group Inc.,\\xa0Willis Towers Watson, American International Group, Allstate, The Hartford, and Marsh & McLennan.\\nFor those convinced recession is imminent, there aren't as many choices. Yet there are two clear equity refuges for weathering a recessionary storm: consumer staples and health care.\\nConsumer staples companies produce retail goods that people buy regardless of what the economy is doing — food, personal care items and household products. During recessions, people still eat, bathe, clean their homes and do laundry.\\nStill suppressed from the bear market, most consumer staples ETFs have had low single-digit returns this year. Currently buyable names include: Campbell Soup Co., General Mills, The Hershey Co., Kellogg's, Kimberly-Clark Corp., Kroger, Procter & Gamble and Walmart.\\nHealth care is also still beaten up from the bear market, with many sector ETFs posting low single-digit or flat returns this year. But long-term demand for medical services, supplies and devices is certain in a nation where more than 10,000 Americans turn 65 each day. These demographics make health care both a defensive sector and a perennial offensive play.\\nPent-up demand from patients who had put off elective surgeries, such as hip and knee replacements, until after the pandemic remains quite strong as patients wait to get into operating rooms.\\xa0This has dinged some health insurers but has helped health-care companies, including those held by iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI), which is up 7.3% for the three-month period ended in mid-June.\\nSector names with reasonable risk levels and good growth prospects include: Vertex Pharmaceuticals, IDEXX Laboratories, DaVita Inc., Veeva Systems Inc., IQVIA Holdings Inc., Cigna Group and Zoetis Inc.\\nRecession or no, there's one sector that should work for both camps: technology. In May, the Nasdaq entered bull territory, and projections suggest this bovine will run well into next year, at least. Twelve-month forward earnings forecasts for the sector have been revised upward 20% since November, compared to only 3% for the S&P 500.\\nAs tech earnings gain momentum, high-priced megacap tech behemoths dominate growth funds. Meanwhile, smaller, lower-valuation companies with good growth prospects are being overlooked. Relatively low-risk stocks with good potential in a category I call TARP — tech at a reasonable price — currently include: Cognizant Technology, Cisco, FLEETCOR Technologies, CDW, Amphenol, Keysight Technologies Inc., ADP and Motorola Solutions Inc.\\nAs the market always looks forward and equity growth seems to be broadening, the investing priorities of no-recession bulls and recession bears focused on the long term may be starting to overlap.\\xa0\\xa0\\n— By Dave Sheaff Gilreath, certified financial planner and partner and chief investment officer of Sheaff Brock Investment Advisors, LLC, and Innovative Portfolios\\n\",\n",

That\\'s on top of more than 8,800 U.S. delays and close to 2,250 cancellations Monday.\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration paused flights bound for New York\\'s LaGuardia Airport, John F.

The FAA said that the thunderstorms were blocking arrival and departure routes.\\nThe disruptions come ahead of the busy Fourth of July holiday travel period, when millions are expected to fly. The Transportation Security Administration said it could screen more travelers than in 2019, before the pandemic, raising competition for spare seats.\\nThe Biden administration has pressured airlines to improve their operations after widespread flight disruptions last spring and summer, which prompted carriers to trim their overambitious schedules. But the industry struggled to recover this past weekend from a series of thunderstorms that didn\\'t let up for days.\\nThunderstorms are difficult for airlines because they can form with less warning than other major weather obstacles like winter storms or hurricanes. Rolling delays could force crews to reach federally mandated workday limits and further worsen disruptions.\\nAbout 30,000 flights have arrived late since Saturday, FlightAware data showed, with cancellation rates from Saturday through Monday up more than three times the average for the year.\\nSome airline executives have also blamed some of the disruptions on shortages of air traffic controllers.\\nUnited Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told staff on Monday that \"the FAA frankly failed us this weekend.\" He said that during Saturday\\'s storms the FAA reduced arrival rates by 40% and departures by 75% at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, one of the airline\\'s biggest hubs.\\n\"It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,\" Kirby wrote in a staff note, which was seen by CNBC. \"And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.\"\\nAn FAA spokesman said in a statement, \"We will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem.\"\\nThe staffing challenges aren\\'t new. The Covid-19 pandemic derailed hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, and the agency is now trying to catch up.\\nThe Department of Transportation\\'s Office of Inspector General said in a report last week that air traffic control staffing shortfalls put air traffic operations at risk. In March, the FAA and some airlines agreed to reduce flights to help ease congestion at busy New York airports because of the staffing issues.\\nBut the problems persist at a time when airlines are readying crews and schedules for a busy summer season, fueled by sustained travel demand.\\nAnd the disruptions frustrated flight crews who were left waiting on hold for reassignments.\\nThe Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents flight attendants at United and others said in a memo to members Monday that hold times for crew scheduling were longer than three hours.\\n\"There is an absolute recognition by Union leadership and Inflight management that something must be done in order to permanently address these adverse situations resulting from irregular operations,\" the union said.\\nIn response to the union\\'s memo, United said it has \"deployed all available resources to catch up on call volume, including increasing staffing in crew scheduling and mandatory overtime on the scheduling team.\"\\nThe airline is offering flight attendants triple pay to pick up trips between June 27 through July 6, according to a message from their union.\\nNew York-based JetBlue Airways also faced high levels of flight delays over the past few days and acknowledged it can improve how it handles disruptions in a note to crew members Monday, which was reviewed by CNBC.\\nDon Uselmann, vice president of inflight experience at JetBlue, said the airline could have updated crew reporting times more efficiently so staff wouldn\\'t be waiting for flights and reducing wait times for hotel assignments.\\n\"Summer peak is officially underway, and extreme weather events, ATC staffing constraints, and the resulting delays will put all airlines to the test,\" he said in his note. \"This weekend\\'s [irregular operation] won\\'t be our last, but the combination of events put acute pressure on the operation and made it more challenging than most.\"\\n',\n",

On Wednesday, Scott Kirby took a private jet from New Jersey\\'s Teterboro Airport to Denver, Colorado.\\nA spokeswoman for the airline told CNBC that United did not pay for his flight. Kirby apologized to staff and travelers on Friday for taking the private jet when so many others were stranded.\\n\"Taking a private jet was the wrong decision because it was insensitive to our customers who were waiting to get home,\" Kirby said in a statement to CNBC. \"I sincerely apologize to our customers and our team members who have been working around-the-clock for several days — often through severe weather — to take care of our customers.\\n\"Watching our team firsthand with our customers at four different airports and during countless meetings this week, it\\'s clear to me they represent the best of United, and I regret that I have distracted from their professionalism,\" he continued. \"I promise to better demonstrate my respect for the dedication of our team members and the loyalty of our customers.\"\\nUnited said on Friday afternoon that its performance was improving into the holiday weekend.

The struggles come as travel demand bounces back from pandemic lows.\\nMore storms and challenges like wildfire smoke from Canada are likely to plague airlines in the days ahead, though the worst of the disruptions this week have mostly subsided. (Of course, if your flight is canceled or delayed, here\\'s what airlines owe you.)\\nMore than 42,000 flights operated by U.S. airlines were delayed from Saturday through Thursday, and more than 7,900 were scrubbed altogether, according to flight-tracker site FlightAware. More than 5% of U.S. schedules were canceled, about four times higher than the cancellation rate so far this year.\\nOver that six-period period, half of United\\'s mainline flights arrived late, amounting to average delays of 106 minutes, according to FlightAware data. Another 19% of its schedule was canceled.\\nUnion leaders blamed United for some of the problems, which stranded crews along with passengers during the disruptions. Flight disruptions often snowball because crews and aircraft are out of position and long delays can have them run into federally-mandated work limits.\\nUnited has been offering flight attendants triple pay to pick up shifts over the peak holiday period.\\n\"United management\\'s failure to properly staff crew schedulers, the flight attendant support team and more has exacerbated these operational issues and left passengers and Flight Attendants waiting for answers for hours at a time,\" Ken Diaz, president of the United chapter of the Association of Flight Attendants, said in a statement Thursday. \"The airline actually \\'lost\\' crews in the system for days on end because there was such a significant breakdown in running the operation.\"\\nGarth Thompson, a United captain and chairman of the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association union, accused the company of not investing in the operation.\\n\"Summer flying can be challenging, but this summer will be unnecessarily memorable,\" he said. \"To those caught up in management\\'s unforced errors, I\\'m truly sorry.\"\\nBoth unions are engaged in contract negotiations with the company and are seeking compensation and scheduling improvements.\\nUnited CEO Kirby on Monday wrote to staff that some of the issues last weekend stemmed from air traffic controller understaffing, and said that \"the FAA frankly failed us\" when it slashed arrival and departure rates at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, a major United hub.\\nThe FAA had warned about staffing shortages in the New York City area earlier this year, and some airlines agreed to reduce capacity to avoid overloading the system.\\n\"It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position,\" Kirby wrote in a staff note, which was seen by CNBC. \"And that put everyone behind the eight ball when weather actually did hit on Sunday and was further compounded by FAA staffing shortages Sunday evening.\"\\nJetBlue also blamed the FAA for similar issues.\\n\"We are working with the FAA to better understand what led to the significant and unexpected ATC restrictions this week that affected thousands of flights across carriers,\" JetBlue\\'s COO, Joanna Geraghty, said in a memo to employees Wednesday. \"The severity and lengthy duration of the latest programs were worse than we have seen in the past with similar weather and this has left tens of thousands of our Customers inconvenienced and, in many cases, blaming JetBlue for a situation outside of our control.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'It\\'s not an easy time to be a small business in search of financing. For LGBTQ owners, the struggle has been even harder.\\nLGBTQ-owned businesses reported more rejections than non-LGBTQ businesses that applied for funding, according to a 2022 report from Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank that focuses on equality and opportunity, and the Center for LGBTQ Economic Advancement & Research (CLEAR).\\nWith the tightening of lending standards, they could be at even more risk of falling behind, said Spencer Watson, president and executive director of CLEAR.\\n\"The tighter economic conditions, the higher interest rates, the collapse of these smaller community banks and the resulting constriction of lending is certainly more detrimental for the LGBTQ community than non-LGBTQ community,\" Watson said.\\nConcerns about the economy and lending conditions aren\\'t only on the minds of LGTBQ entrepreneurs. Overall, small business owners are skeptical about their future business conditions, said Holly Wade, executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business\\' Research Center.\\n\"The small business economy is being hindered by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages,\" she said. \"While financing isn\\'t a top problem for small businesses, owners have expressed concerns about the health of the banking system for their business purposes in light of the banking turbulence in March.\"\\nYet, data show that when it comes to financing, LGTBQ small business owners are being left behind. In 2021, 46% of LGBTQ-owned businesses said they didn\\'t receive any of the financing they had applied to in 2021, according to the MAP/CLEAR report. In comparison, 35% of non-LGBTQ businesses that applied for funding were rejected, the report found. Much of the funding sought was through the Covid relief programs offered, Watson said.\\n\"Those businesses were frequently smaller in size and they were also frequently younger and they had smaller revenues,\" Watson explained. \"They were struggling with those additional pressures because they were already in a weaker financial position to start with.\"\\nWatson said there are similar themes emerging in the analysis of the 2022 Federal Reserve\\'s small business credit survey, which hasn\\'t been fully released yet.\\nWhile LGBTQ small business owners are very optimistic, they are also still more likely to report more kinds of financial challenges than non-LGBTQ businesses. Some six in 10 reported difficulties affording operating expenses over the last year, according to Watson, who prefers a gender-neutral pronoun. Most of the businesses are owned by people who identify as LGBTQ but their businesses aren\\'t necessarily oriented towards or servicing the LGBTQ community, they said.\\nGavin Escolar, owner of The Chaga Company in San Francisco, is one of those small business owners that has had troubling finding financing. The 47-year-old gay man started his business, which makes products from chaga mushrooms, in 2018 by using his savings and credit cards. While he hasn\\'t been rejected for any loans he\\'s applied for, he has been only offered high-interest bridge loans from lenders to hold him over until a lower-interest small business loan becomes available, he said.\\n\"They\\'re like, \\'oh yeah, you\\'re pretty much approved for this particular SBA loan, but it\\'s going to take like around six months for you to get it. But we have this other loan that you can bridge right now, that is 29.75%,\\' or whatever exuberant cost,\" Escolar said.\\nRight now he\\'s using loans from Square and PayPal and is hoping to figure out his next step so that he can pay down his credit card debt, buy inventory and do marketing. Escolar feels like the community needs more education on how to get the right financing.\\n\"I\\'m only getting the higher [interest loans] because I feel like I don\\'t have established business credit,\" Escolar said. \"I\\'m fluctuating between my business credit and my personal credit. I don\\'t even know where to start on how to build a business credit.\"\\nFor 43-year-old Sarah Scala, going into debt wasn\\'t an option when she started her business, Sarah Scala Consulting. The Massachusetts company is an LGBT-certified business enterprise that provides leadership development, public speaking and leadership coaching.\\nScala wanted to stay debt free, so she used her own savings and looked for opportunities elsewhere. Other than a Paycheck Protection Program loan during the Covid-19 pandemic, her only other external source of funding has been two grants from the Massachusetts Growth Capital Corporation. Those grants have helped her with digital marketing and capital expenses.\\n\"There\\'s a number of wonderful associations that are really helpful if people are looking for support around funding,\" said Scala, who operates the business out of her home.\\nOne is SCORE, a network of volunteer business mentors, which Scala is involved with. She also has a strong partnership with the Massachusetts LGBT Chamber of Commerce, which can help open doors, she said.\\nAnti-LGBTQ bias and discrimination against LGBTQ small-businesses can arise during the loan process in a number of places, Watson said.\\n\"If the lender discerns the applicants\\' LGBTQ identity, they may choose to deny that loan or charge the applicant a higher cost for the credit they are approved for,\" they explained. \"This is particularly the case for highly visible members of the LGBTQ community — such as transgender or nonconforming gender presentations.\"\\nIt can also show up in other ways, like if a creditor doesn\\'t understand the business\\'s market opportunity, like not seeing the benefit or market need for an LGBTQ-serving establishment, Watson said.\\nBusinesses oriented explicitly toward individuals of sexual minorities and that create sex-positive spaces are also frequently excused because Small Business Administration guidelines forbid loans for businesses of a \"prurient sexual nature,\" they said.\\nHowever, Watson cheered the recent rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that increases transparency in small business lending and includes demographic information, allowing small businesses to identify as women-, minority-, or LGBTQ-owned.\\n\"Implementing that data collection would be an incredible boon to combating discrimination in the private lending market for small businesses,\" they said.\\nThe success of these businesses matter — not only for the owners but for the community at large, Watson said.\\n\"There is a need for more small businesses owned by all types of marginalized communities so that those entrepreneurs can support themselves, their fellow community members, and create more inclusive spaces that are authentically by and for those communities,\" they said.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nUnited Airlines\\' CEO Scott Kirby said that without more gates the airline will have to reduce or change schedules to handle frequent gridlock at its Newark, New Jersey, hub, a message that came after mass flight delays marred July Fourth holiday weekend travel. The carrier gave 30,000 frequent flyer miles to customers who were most affected by the chaos.\\n\"This has been one of the most operationally challenging weeks I\\'ve experienced in my entire career,\" Kirby said in a note to staff Saturday.\\nHe said that the airline needs more gates at Newark Liberty International Airport because of frequent aircraft backups there. \"We are going to have to further change/reduce our schedule to give ourselves even more spare gates and buffer — especially during thunderstorm season,\" he added. United didn\\'t provide more detail on the schedule reductions.\\nA day earlier, Kirby apologized for taking a private jet out of New Jersey\\'s Teterboro Airport while thousands of passengers were stranded, CNBC first reported Friday.\\nProblems began with a series of thunderstorms in some of the country\\'s most congested airspace along the East Coast last weekend, cutting off routes for aircraft. While most airlines recovered, United\\'s problems continued during the week, angering both customers and crews. United and JetBlue Airways executives said air traffic control problems worsened the disruptions.\\nThe difficult week was also among the busiest. The Transportation Security Administration said it screened a record of nearly 2.89 million people on July 1 alone, topping a previous high on the Sunday after Thanksgiving in 2019.\\nKirby laid out the weeklong troubles and said long-term changes were needed. He said that extensively delayed departures, which piled up at its hub at Newark since last weekend, hurt its operation. Takeoffs were reduced by as much as 75% for longer than eight hours in some cases from Sunday through Tuesday.\\n\"Airlines, including United, simply aren\\'t designed to have their largest hub have its capacity severely limited for four straight days and still operate successfully,\" he wrote.\\nAircraft and crews were then left out of position, something that happens often during severe weather and can spark a cascade of disruptions for customers.\\nUnions complained about hours-long waits for crew members to get assignments and get hotels, forcing them to stay at airports longer.\\nKen Diaz, president of the United chapter of the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents the company\\'s cabin crews, said in a note to members on Friday that the airline is short on crew schedulers. He said that problems became so severe over the past week that schedulers weren\\'t clear on which city some crews were in.\\nKirby said that United must improve the platforms so crews can get assignments and accommodation more easily on its app, saying what happened over the past week isn\\'t acceptable.\\nKirby called for more investment in the FAA and air traffic control to avoid delays and staffing shortages, some of which occurred after hiring and training paused early in the Covid pandemic.\\nUnited sent the 30,000 miles to customers who were delayed overnight or didn\\'t get to their destination at all, a spokeswoman said. She declined to say how many customers received the email.\\nThe sum is enough to redeem for a domestic roundtrip ticket to many destinations, though the miles required vary based on demand for that flight or route.\\nMore than 63,000 U.S. flights arrived late from June 24 through Sunday, and more than 9,000 were canceled — or more than 4% of airlines\\' schedules — a rate nearly three times the average so far this year, according to flight-tracker FlightAware. United fared worse than competitors with 47% of its mainline schedule arriving late and 15% canceled over that period, FlightAware data show.\\nOn Sunday, 7,650 U.S. flights were delayed and more than 630 canceled — driven in large part by thunderstorms on the East Coast. Nearly 900 United flights were delayed, or a third of its operation, while close to 1,000 American Airlines flights were delayed and more than 300 JetBlue Airways flights were late. New York City-area airports, led by Newark, were the hardest hit.\\nThunderstorms are one of airlines\\' biggest challenges because they can pop up suddenly and are harder to predict compared with hurricanes or winter storms, when airlines can cancel flights ahead of time to avoid stranding passengers and crews.\\n',\n",

Microsoft employs the strategy as well for its Xbox, though Nadella said his company is a \"low share player in the console market.\"\\nRegarding exclusive deals, Nadella said \"I have no love for that world.\" \\nNadella spoke at a hearing in federal court in San Francisco, as the Federal Trade Commission seeks judicial support to prevent Microsoft from closing its $68.7 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard. The FTC is worried that the tie-up could allow Microsoft to withhold popular games in Activision\\'s library from other consoles or degrade service for those games elsewhere.\\nMicrosoft has said it wants to add Activision games to its Game Pass subscription service. To quell regulator concerns, Microsoft has offered 10-year agreements to make Activision\\'s popular Call of Duty titles available for Sony and Nintendo consoles. \\nSony hasn\\'t accepted Microsoft\\'s offer and is opposed to its acquisition of Activision. \\n\"I believe that this transaction is bad for competition,\" Jim Ryan, head of Sony Interactive Entertainment, said in a video deposition that was played in court on Tuesday.\\nNadella\\'s view on consoles reflects his broader approach to technology platforms. Since becoming CEO in 2014, he\\'s changed the culture at a company long known for proprietary closed systems, attempting to ensure that its software can work well on multiple devices, not just its own hardware.\\nMicrosoft has brought its Office productivity applications to Apple\\'s iPad and its SQL Server database software to Linux. In earlier years, Microsoft prioritized Windows, but today the operating system is no longer the crucial source of revenue that it was. In the fiscal third quarter, Microsoft said Windows represented just over 10% of revenue, down from about 25% in 2011.\\nA Microsoft spokesperson said Nadella\\'s comments on Wednesday \"made it abundantly clear that Microsoft will honor its commitments to its partners and the gaming community to bring more games to more players.\"\\xa0\\nNadella also acknowledges that, when it comes to gaming, Microsoft has challenges. Microsoft\\'s cloud service, which is available in Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions, is \"just not good enough\" as a substitute for current platforms, he said.\\nActivision CEO Bobby Kotick is skeptical of multi-game subscription services in general. He said in court on Wednesday that his company has experimented with them, including working with Nvidia\\'s GeForce Now while it was in a testing phase. \\nKotick, whose company is based in Santa Monica, California, said he still wants to get the deal done with Microsoft even if he holds a differing opinion on subscriptions and whether they present a big opportunity. \\n\"Maybe part of it is being in Los Angeles and having watched the big media companies move their content to these subscription streaming services, and the business results have suffered,\" Kotick said.\\nJudge Jacqueline Scott Corley will decide if the FTC will receive a preliminary injunction that would stop Microsoft from closing the deal. Meanwhile, in the U.K., the Competition and Markets Authority moved to block the transaction in April.\\n\"My board\\'s view is if the preliminary injunction is granted, they don\\'t see how the deal can continue,\" Kotick said.\\nWATCH: FTC injunction on Microsoft-Activision merger \\'a positive development\\', says TD Cowen\\'s Aaron Glick\\n',\n",

She said only when 5G becomes part of the ecosystem can it be possible to realize operations at scale.\\nMeng was speaking at a keynote session at the Shanghai Mobile World Congress on Wednesday, where she spoke broadly about the benefits of 5G to consumption and the economy.\\nThe Chinese smartphone maker has sought to sell cloud services to specific industries such as mining and finance.\\nThe company broke out figures for its cloud computing business for the first time in 2022, and said revenue for the unit came in at 45.3 billion Chinese yuan ($6.25 billion) last year.\\n\"When you compare MWC Shanghai and MWC Barcelona [earlier this year], one interesting aspect is you find a lot of the case studies are universal, global,\" said Winston Ma, author of \"The Digital War: How China\\'s Tech Power Shapes the Future of AI, Blockchain and Cyberspace.\"\\nSpeaking on the sidelines of Shanghai MWC, he said Chinese companies\\' need to compete could spur greater adoption of 5G.\\n\"So I think the Chinese companies are probably more ready, are more willing to test new 5G applications,\" said Ma, who is also an adjunct professor of law at New York University.\\n\"But of course there will be barriers for whatever industry, especially for the traditional industries, they have their existing ecosystem.\"\\nLast year, Huawei saw its biggest annual decline in profit as U.S. sanctions hit its business and China\\'s Covid-19 controls weighed on the local economy.\\nIn May 2019, the Trump administration put Huawei on a blacklist that restricted U.S. companies from selling technology to the Chinese company due to national security concerns. Huawei has denied it poses such a threat.\\nThe U.S., U.K. and Australia, have also banned Huawei from operating in their 5G networks. Earlier this month, a top EU official called for more members of the bloc to do so. Germany is among the countries that have not yet restricted Huawei from its local 5G network.\\nMeng, the daughter of Huawei\\'s founder, returned to China in 2021 — after about nearly three years of being detained in Canada at the request of the U.S. In addition to being Huawei\\'s CFO, she is also deputy chairwoman of Huawei\\'s board and rotating chairwoman.\\n— CNBC\\'s Arjun Kharpal and Ryan Browne contributed to this report.\\nCorrection: This story has been updated to show that Huawei saw its biggest annual decline in profit last year.\\n',\n",

The complaint could be filed in the coming weeks, Bloomberg said.\\nSuch a lawsuit would be a huge milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who became a known figure in the antitrust world in 2017 when The Yale Law Journal published her note, \"Amazon\\'s Antitrust Paradox.\" In it, Khan argued that the prevailing antitrust framework at the time failed to adequately assess Amazon\\'s vast power and the ways it could use it to harm competition.\\nHer past writing is part of what sparked Amazon to ask for her recusal from its antitrust cases because the company believes she lacks impartiality in the matter. Meta made a similar request, but Khan has so far declined to sit out.\\nThe FTC has already taken action against Amazon in other areas, including a recent consumer protection lawsuit alleging the platform has used deceptive tactics to get users to sign up for its Prime subscriptions and \"sabotaged\" their attempts to cancel. It also recently settled two separate cases alleging privacy lapses in its Alexa voice assistant and Ring video security products.\\nBut the antitrust complaint against Amazon\\'s core business is the action most FTC watchers have been waiting for. According to Bloomberg, the expected complaint is based in part on evidence the FTC has collected that Amazon allegedly disadvantages sellers that don\\'t use its logistics services.\\nWhile it\\'s possible for both parties to reach a settlement before charges are formally filed, Khan has signaled she prefers structural changes such as breakups over promises from companies to change their behavior, which make a settlement less likely.\\nThe FTC and Amazon declined to comment to CNBC.\\nRead the full story on Bloomberg.\\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.\\nWATCH: A look inside Amazon\\'s new $2.5 billion headquarters in Arlington, Virginia\\n',\n",

That\\'s especially true now, with President Joe Biden considering stricter controls on the export of powerful artificial intelligence computing chips to the world\\'s second-largest economy.\\nThe BIS is responsible for implementing the U.S. export control regime, preventing critical high-tech and defense products from getting into the hands of the wrong companies or governments. The decisions made by the BIS about who can and can\\'t access U.S. technology can have a major effect on corporate bottom lines.\\nChipmakers have already taken a hit as a result of BIS-imposed restrictions. In 2022, the BIS warned Nvidia that new licensing requirements precluded the export of the company\\'s advanced A100 and H100 chips to China without obtaining a license from the Commerce Department, part of the Biden administration\\'s sweeping effort to curb Chinese technological advancement.\\nNvidia warned in August 2022 that about $400 million in potential Chinese sales would be lost unless customers purchased \"alternative product offerings.\" Just a few months later, Nvidia began to offer a watered-down version of its flagship AI chip for the Chinese market. Dubbed the A800, its lower-end specifications exempted it from Commerce Department licensing requirements.\\nBut The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that even the less-powerful Nvidia offering could be restricted from export at the direction of President Biden. The BIS declined to comment on a potential tightening of export controls. Nvidia shares, which have soared 180% this year largely on AI hype, fell 2% after the WSJ story.\\nThrough its Commerce Control List, the BIS can define which product specifications require licenses to be sold overseas. The criteria can be so specific that only a handful of commercially available items apply.\\nWhile the Commerce Control List isn\\'t intended to single out any one vendor, there are very few companies that develop the kind of high-octane processors that power AI models. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices lead that group.\\nIf an export restriction were implemented, those companies would be responsible for ensuring their high-tech processors don\\'t end up in the Chinese markets.\\nIn one high-profile enforcement case, the BIS took aim at hard drive manufacturer Seagate over the company\\'s decision to continue supplying Huawei after the Chinese company was blacklisted in 2020. Seagate was fined $300 million by the government.

Earlier this month, the company announced a business change that will dramatically increase the price for third-party developers to use the company\\'s application programming interface, or API. \\nReddit\\'s third-party apps are popular with users, who use them to browse the site and help address accessibility challenges, and with moderators, who use them to organize their subreddits, block spam accounts, flag unsafe posts and find patterns of harassment and abuse.\\xa0\\nIn response to a question about whether the developers would return to posting on Reddit if the company changed its API policy, the user \"sliced_lime,\" whose bio says they are a Minecraft developer at Mojang, wrote, \"The decision is based on the current situation, if the situation was to change we\\'d have to discuss that then.\"\\nWith more than 230 million copies sold, Minecraft is considered by Guinness World Records to be the world\\'s best-selling video game, and its official subreddit has more than 7.4 million members. Although the subreddit will live on without official updates from Mojang Studios, day-to-day use could look significantly different for members.\\xa0\\nAhead of the changes, which are slated to go into effect Saturday, more than 8,000 Reddit communities participated in a \"blackout,\" changing their subreddit settings to fully or partially private. The protests included the wildly popular r/Funny, with more than 40 million members, along with r/Music and r/Science, each boasting more than 30 million users.\\xa0\\n\"Reddit not only has all of its content generated by users, but all of its moderation is done by volunteers,\" Dac Croach, one of the moderators of r/Gaming, which has more than 37 million members, told CNBC in a recent interview. \"We\\'re talking hundreds of thousands of volunteers putting in hours a day to keep the site safe, entertaining and enjoyable for community members. And it\\'s tough to see that those people, when their voices are loud like this, are being ostensibly ignored.\"\\xa0\\nA Reddit spokesperson declined to comment.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'The first drug fully generated by artificial intelligence entered clinical trials with human patients this week.\\nInsilico Medicine, a Hong Kong-based biotech startup with more than $400 million in funding, created the drug, INS018_055, as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic disease that causes scarring in the lungs. The condition, which has increased in prevalence in recent decades, currently affects about 100,000 people in the U.S. and can lead to death within two to five years if untreated, according to the National Institutes of Health.\\xa0\\n\"It is the first fully generative AI drug to reach human clinical trials, and specifically Phase II trials with patients,\" Alex Zhavoronkov, founder and CEO of Insilico Medicine, told CNBC. \"While there are other AI-designed drugs in trials, ours is the first drug with both a novel AI-discovered target and a novel AI-generated design.\"\\xa0\\nThe discovery process for the new drug began in 2020, with hopes to create a \"moonshot\" medicine to overcome challenges with current treatments for the condition, which mostly focus on slowing progression and can cause uncomfortable side effects, Zhavoronkov said.\\nHe added that Insilico has chosen to focus on IPF in part because of the condition\\'s implications in aging, but the company has two other drugs partially generated by AI in the clinical stage. One is a Covid-19 drug in phase one clinical trials, and the other is a cancer drug, specifically a \"USP1 inhibitor for the treatment of solid tumors,\" that recently received FDA approval to initiate clinical trials.\\n\"When this company was launched, we were focused on algorithms — developing the technology that could discover and design new molecules,\" Zhavoronkov said. \"I never imagined in those early days that I would be taking my own AI drugs into clinical trials with patients. But we realized that in order to validate our AI platform, we needed to not only design a new drug for a new target, but bring it into clinical trials to prove that our technology worked.\"\\xa0\\nThe IPF drug\\'s current study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial taking place over 12 weeks in China, and Insilico has plans to expand the testing population to 60 subjects at 40 sites in the U.S. and China. If the current phase two study is successful, it will go on to another study with a larger cohort, and then potentially reach phase three studies with hundreds of participants.\\xa0\\n\"We expect to have results from the current Phase II trial next year,\" Zhavoronkov said, adding that it\\'s difficult to predict exact timing for future phases, especially since the disease is relatively rare and patients must fulfill specific criteria. He added, \"We are optimistic that this drug will be ready for market, and reach patients who may benefit from it, in the next few years.\"\\xa0\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nSoLo Funds, a community lending platform created to offer credit to the underbanked and American consumers long shut out of the financial services sector due to pervasive discrimination in the loan process, is expanding for the first time overseas, to Nigeria.\\nFounded by Rodney Williams and Travis Holoway (CEO) in 2018, SoLo Funds has grown to over one million users, the vast majority (82%) of which are from underserved zip codes in America. The company has issued over $200 million in loans and a total of $400 million in transaction volume through a fintech offering that caters to communities that have historically been economically disenfranchised.\\xa0\\nExpansion to Nigeria, Williams said, is a first step on the path to further international growth.\\xa0\\n\"It is the test case. It is the template. It is the first,\" Williams said in an interview with CNBC after revealing the Nigeria plans during a session at the Aspen Ideas Festival earlier this week. \"We are not stopping with Nigeria – we look at Nigeria as the gateway to the continent,\" he said.\\xa0\\nNigeria has both the largest economy in Africa and the fastest-growing middle class. The economic profile of the nation was an important factor in SoLo\\'s decision, which sees its product as an important tool for empowering the middle class, giving them a chance to both make ends meet during times of financial hardship and make a return when they have a bit more of a reliable cash flow.\\xa0\\nNigeria\\'s existing fintech ecosystem was also a plus. \"For us to do what we do, we have to partner,\" Williams said. \"We have to leverage many partners to deliver our solution and those partners have to be in market and be successful in market. And in Nigeria, we saw many examples of that.\"\\xa0\\nOpay and Flutterwave, which made the 2021 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, are two examples of the various fintech unicorns that have found immense success in the country.\\xa0\\nSoLo Funds ranked No. 50 on the 2023 CNBC Disruptor 50 list.\\nWilliams is one of only two founders (the other being Elon Musk) to have two companies make the annual list. Williams, who came from an executive background at Procter & Gamble, first founded Lisnr, whose investors include Visa, Intel, and Synchrony Financial, and has deals in eight countries for its secure digital data transfer technology.\\nIn Nigeria, SoLo Funds has already connected with Paga, a mobile payment company, Platform Capital, an African investing firm based in Nigeria, and Endeavor, an entrepreneurial community network.\\xa0\\nWilliams said the lack of investment opportunities that currently exist in Nigeria is part of the market opportunity for the company. The bank rate offerings for savings in Nigeria are far below the level of inflation.\\n\"The average Nigerian consumer with savings is not growing in any capacity. And that\\'s a characteristic of many developing nations, not just Nigeria. So what that ultimately means is that it has a very, very attractive group of citizens that want to grow their money,\" Williams said.\\xa0\\nSoLo Funds users have the opportunity to lend small amounts of money, ranging from $50-$1,000, to peers on the platform. Borrowers lay out the terms of their loan, including if they want to tip the lender. Through these tips, lenders are able to generate a return.\\xa0Approximately 99% of users choose to tip their lenders, according to the company.\\n\"We believe SoLo is the evolution of microfinance and community finance,\" Williams said. \"We are building a financial product for the masses, and not just the people who have money.\"\\nThat mission has not come without controversy, and allegations that SoLo Funds is creating a new form of predatory short-term lending. Williams referred to the controversy that has trailed the company himself during the Aspen talk, telling attendees, \"Go to Google Search.\"\\nA case brought by banking regulators in Connecticut was recently settled, following resolution to cases in California and Washington, D.C. SoLo Funds has added several lawyers to its staff with experience in the banking, fintech, and regulatory sectors. Williams has argued throughout the controversies that policymakers fail to consider the needs of \"everyday Americans\" when making their decisions.\\xa0\\n\"Every day I wake up,\" he said, \"and I can see a single mom or a dad put food on the table. And I can also see a single dad or a mom make a return. And that return can pay for taking their kids out to the movies this weekend, just as much as it can pay to keep someone\\'s lights on. That\\'s what makes me know that I\\'m doing the right thing. And what excites me about Nigeria, and anywhere else in the world we go, is that we\\'re gonna do it for more people in more places than I think I ever thought we could.\"\\xa0\\nMany startups that have expanded internationally have had to pull back, especially as venture funding has dried up and the growth-at-all-costs startup strategy that dominated for a decade has been replaced by a focus on a quicker path to profits.\\nThe risks of expanding to a middle class market on an international scale, Williams says, are very similar to those in America.\\xa0\\n\"I was just looking at a Twitter post, and it mentioned that banks don\\'t serve [the middle class] because they have said that it\\'s too expensive to serve. And they have said that this consumer is not credit worthy and that\\'s why banks don\\'t build products for them. Well, that\\'s the risk of building a product for mass market,\" Williams said.\\xa0\"We face the same conclusion or the same challenge of why build products for everyone, when, you know, you could build products for the top 10% and be a billion-dollar company?\" he added.\\xa0\\nWilliams said that he plans to address international risk the same way that he addressed risk in the United States – with data, testing, and partnerships with ecosystem leaders.\\xa0The complexity of lending regulation in the U.S. on a state-by-state basis has prepared SoLo Funds for the equally complex international launch.\\xa0\"Even though international expansion sounds like a massive undertaking, when we have analyzed it, it\\'s very similar to introducing new products in the United States on a state-by-state basis,\" he said.\\xa0\\nThe company has plans for additional international markets over the next 12-18 months across multiple continents, starting with key entry countries.\\xa0\\n\"We\\'ve identified that country in Latin America as well. We\\'ve also identified that country in Southeast Asia,\" Williams said.\\xa0\\nNBCUniversal News Group, of which CNBC is a part, is the media partner of the Aspen Ideas Festival.\\n',\n",

It will also shutter a Los Angeles-based studio, where most of the affected employees are based.\\nThe move highlights how the mobile games industry has shifted in the years since Niantic landed its first major hit, Pokemon Go, in 2016. Since then, both Apple and Google\\'s app stores have introduced changes that prevent advertising tracking among apps, which has made advertising to gain new users more expensive and unpredictable.\\nHanke said the reorganization was due to both \"internal and external factors,\" including an overall global macroeconomic slowdown.\\n\"In the years since Pokémon GO\\'s launch, the mobile market has become crowded and changes to the app store and the mobile advertising landscape have made it increasingly hard to launch new mobile games at scale,\" Hanke wrote.\\nNiantic said Thursday that supporting Pokemon Go is the company\\'s \"top priority.\"\\nOverall, App Store spending on games declined 5% in 2020 to $110 billion, according to an estimate from Data.ai, a research firm.\\nThe move also signals a shift in the landscape for augmented reality applications, which can integrate computer graphics and data into the real world.\\nPokemon Go can display a digital monster interacting with the real world through a phone\\'s screen. But the technology is starting to be integrated into headsets or goggles that use powerful cameras to integrate the real and virtual worlds, which many in Silicon Valley see as the next major computing platform. Earlier this year, Meta released its Quest Pro headset and early next year, Apple will release its long-awaited Vision Pro headset.\\nHanke\\'s letter says these new hardware products validate Niantic\\'s strategy, but that it\\'s only an \"intermediate stepping stone\" to true outdoor AR devices, which likely will resemble a lightweight pair of glasses with transparent displays.\\n\"We believe that we can build key content and platform services that will help realize the promise of this technological shift,\" Hanke wrote.\\nStill, Hanke wrote, the AR market is \"developing more slowly than anticipated, because of technology challenges and because larger players are slowing down their investments in light of the macro environment.\"\\nNiantic had 1,050 employees as of 2022 and last raised $300 million at a post-money valuation of $9 billion in November 2021, when tech valuations were at their frothiest peak, as per Pitchbook.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Author Patrick Tomlinson and his wife, business owner Niki Robinson, have been \"swatted\" at their home in Milwaukee more than 40 times, often resulting in police pointing guns at their heads. Their tormentors have also called in false bomb threats to venues using their names in three states. Yet law enforcement hasn\\'t been able to stop the calls.\\nThe couple\\'s terror comes as these incidents appear to be on the rise in the U.S., at least on college campuses. In less than a single week in April, universities including Clemson, Florida, Boston, Harvard, Cornell, Pittsburgh, Rutgers and Oklahoma, as well as Middlebury College, were targeted by swatters.\\nTo combat the growing problem, the FBI has begun taking formal measures to get a comprehensive picture of the problem on a national level.\\nChief Scott Schubert with the bureau\\'s Criminal Justice Information Services headquarters in Clarksburg, West Virginia, told NBC News that the agency formed a national online database in May to facilitate information sharing between hundreds of police departments and law enforcement agencies across the country pertaining to swatting incidents.\\nRead more from NBC News:\\nGoogle says it will remove Canadian news links from searches in the country\\nRecord nighttime heat in Texas poses a sneaky risk to people\\'s health\\nWhy war with China over Taiwan could ruin the global economy\\ufeff\\nSchubert said this effort will provide the bureau with \"a common operating picture of what\\'s going on across the country.\" He added, \"We\\'re taking every step to monitor this national problem and help however we can.\"\\nSecurity expert Lauren R. Shapiro, who is an associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said: \"Swatting involves people making fraudulent 911 calls reporting serious-level criminal threats or violent situations like bomb threats, hostages, killing, etc. to fool the police into raiding the house or business of somebody who is not actually committing a crime.\"\\xa0\\nSwatting can have deadly consequences. In 2021, Mark Herring\\xa0died of a heart attack\\xa0during a police response to his Tennessee home caused by a fraudulent report of a shooting.\\xa0\\nPatrick Tomlinson and his wife, Niki Robinson.NBC News\\nAnd in 2017, a Wichita police officer — who didn\\'t realize a caller had falsely reported a homicide and hostage situation at the\\xa0home of Andrew Finch\\xa0— killed Finch, 28.\\xa0\\nSuch fatalities are incredibly rare, Shapiro noted, to the credit of highly trained SWAT teams responding to false calls.\\nNo central agency has tracked swatting incidents or suspects in the U.S., so official statistics are not available. By 2019, there were an estimated 1,000 swatting incidents domestically each year, according to a report from the Anti-Defamation League, and each incident is estimated to cost at least $10,000 to affected communities, even before expenditures on follow-up work like investigations, property repairs and counseling.\\nSwatting is increasingly enabled by technology that can be used to mask a caller\\'s real voice, their phone number or IP address (also called \"spoofing\") or to make their false report sound more credible.\\xa0\\nSchubert told NBC News that the FBI\\'s new centralized database should help the agency \"get that common picture of what\\'s going on across our nation so we can learn from that.\"\\nTomlinson\\'s troubles began after he posted a casual remark on Twitter in 2018 saying he\\'d never personally found the comedian Norm Macdonald very funny. As\\xa0The Daily Beast\\xa0reported, the tweet caught the attention of online trolls who soon began to harass, stalk, impersonate and defame Tomlinson and his wife, using a website of their own along with social media accounts on Reddit, Twitter and YouTube to target the couple and invite others to pile on.\\xa0\\nTheir harassers mostly converge on a website that\\'s cloned elsewhere so participants can migrate rapidly if their forum is ever banned by a service provider.\\xa0\\n\\xa0Since The Daily Beast report, the harassment escalated both online and offline.\\nThe couple was mostly recently swatted at their home on Tuesday, bringing the total of swatting incidents to 43. Tomlinson\\'s parents, who are senior citizens, also suffered swatting at their home about 2 hours outside of Milwaukee this year.\\xa0\\n\"It\\'s taken away our sanctuary,\" Tomlinson said of the constant harassment, adding: \"We don\\'t feel safe in our own home. We don\\'t know when the door\\'s going to get kicked in.\"\\xa0\\nTomlinson described one incident: \"I make my way downstairs to find that there are half a dozen police with pistols drawn, shotguns, AR-15s, all pointed and flashlights all pointed at my head. I am pulled out of the house, and then on my own front porch I\\'m immediately handcuffed.\"\\nPolice handcuff Patrick Tomlinson outside his house in Milwaukee.\\xa0Courtesy Patrick Tomlinson\\nBesides misusing emergency services, impersonators also fraudulently called the couple\\'s natural gas provider, We Energies, to have their heat cut off during cold Wisconsin nights on two occasions, most recently in March, according to records shared by the family.\\n\"We woke up with our breath visible indoors. Temperatures were in the 50s in our house,\" Tomlinson said, putting the couple and their pets (two cats and a bearded dragon lizard) in danger.\\nFalse threats using the couples\\' names have also reached a favorite local Irish pub twice this year, causing police to bring bomb sniffing dogs to the bar during a Marquette game on one occasion.\\nSwatters also called in a false bomb threat to the American Family Field, the baseball stadium where the Milwaukee Brewers play, on a night when Tomlinson had publicly posted that they would be in attendance. And on Dec. 10, 2022, false bomb threats mentioning Tomlinson caused the evacuation of thousands of fans from a\\xa0Patti Labelle concert at\\xa0the Riverside Theater in Milwaukee.\\xa0\\nThe couple says they have spent tens of thousands of dollars in the last five years in a bid to protect themselves. Among other items, they said they purchased high-end home security systems, personal defense weapons and more.\\nTomlinson and Robinson filed a lawsuit against the owners of an online forum that their stalkers have used to target them. But their case was never heard by the court because they had no names of website owners to sue. They sent a subpoena to obtain those names to a web services provider, Cloudflare, but that was quashed. They were forced to withdraw the suit and now say they owe more than $50,000 in legal fees to the very people attacking them — enough to possibly bankrupt them, the couple said.\\xa0\\nWhile the earliest recorded case of swatting occurred in 2002, to this day, there is no specific law criminalizing swatting in the U.S., says John Jay\\'s Shapiro.\\n\"Without a statute in place, there\\'s no designated resources or training for investigating swatting incidents,\" she said. \"And the 911 dispatchers do not have the resources and training they need\\xa0 to differentiate between actual emergencies and false reports.\"\\nLegally, the False Information and Hoaxes statute, also known as section 1038, is most frequently used to prosecute swatting. Other statutes can sometimes apply — one pertaining to interstate threats involving explosives and another pertaining to interstate communications, which refers to extortion or threats to injure or kidnap somebody.\\n\"Too often, perpetrators are getting a slap on the wrist compared to the consequences suffered by their victims,\" Shapiro said.\\nAs far as law enforcement goes, the couple and their predicament is now familiar to the Milwaukee Police Department. During the most recent swatting incident, police went to their home and simply left a calling card but did not wake the couple up, let alone point guns at their faces as in the past.\\nRobinson is something of an advocate for training police to deal with swatting as a result of her experience.\\nShe said that she had to explain to police what swatting is while they were pointing guns at her at her own front door. \"There is no excuse for any police department, any police officer to not know what swatting is, and every department in this country should have policies, procedures and training around it. It has existed for over a decade. People have died from it. It\\'s insane.\"\\n\\xa0The Milwaukee Police Department said in a statement: \"MPD has a duty to respond to calls for service in order to ensure that no one is in danger and that the necessary precautions are taken into consideration during these incidents.\"\\nAt a federal level, Tomlinson filed a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center in November 2020. He never saw a reply to that, so in early May 2022, he went to the Milwaukee branch of the FBI in person to file a new one.\\nAn FBI special agent was assigned to evaluate his case. He says the agency already had a file on Tomlinson because of a false bomb threat that swatters had called into a hotel outside of Detroit in April 2022, a few weeks prior to a presentation he was scheduled to give. The presentation, part of PenguiCon, was titled,\"Elon Musk is Full of S---.\"\\xa0\\nSince then, \"There has been nearly zero communication by the FBI,\" Tomlinson said.\\xa0\\nOne agent has requested more evidence from his family by email on rare occasions. But the agency has not brought him or his wife in for an interview, and have not arrested people who the couple identified as participants in their harassment and swatting.\\nThe FBI\\'s Schubert couldn\\'t comment on their specific case but recommended, generally, \"If you receive a swatting threat or information that an individual is planning to engage in a swatting event, then immediately contact your local law enforcement.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'In this article\\nThe Netherlands on Friday announced new export restrictions on advanced semiconductor equipment amid U.S. pressure to cut China off from key chipmaking tools.\\nCompanies in the Netherlands will need to apply for a license to export certain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment\\xa0overseas, the Dutch government said, under rules that will come into effect on Sept. 1.\\nThe Netherlands is home to ASML, one of the most important semiconductor companies in the world. ASML makes machinery that is required to produce the most advanced chips.\\nASML shares were down 1.5% on Friday.\\nLast October, the U.S. introduced sweeping rules aiming to cut off exports of key chips and semiconductor tools to China, a move analysts said could hobble Beijing\\'s ambitions to boost its domestic technology. Since then, the U.S. has been ramping up pressure on key chipmaking nations and allies like the Netherlands and Japan, to introduce export restrictions of their own.\\nBecause of ASML\\'s critical role in advanced chips, Washington has sought to get the Netherlands on side. The Dutch government was on the fence but in March laid out restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor equipment. Friday\\'s announcement finalizes those rules and gives more clarity around what can and can\\'t be exported.\\nThe law does not single out any country nor does it name ASML explicitly.\\nThe Dutch government said the rules apply to a \"number of very specific technologies for the development and manufacture of advanced semiconductors,\" that could potentially be used in places like military applications.\\n\"We\\'ve taken this step on national security grounds. It\\'s good for the companies that will be impacted to know what they can expect. This will give them the time they need to adapt to the new rules,\" Dutch Trade Minister\\xa0Liesje Schreinemacher said in a statement.\\nASML\\'s machines are used by advanced chip manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. There are two key tools it makes.\\nThe first is a so-called\\xa0immersion deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machine, which is used to manufacture memory chips. These chips are used in a plethora of devices, from smartphones to laptops and servers, and could ultimately be used for artificial intelligence applications.\\xa0\\nThe second is called an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine which is used to make more advanced chips.\\nASML said it will now need to apply for a license to export its most advanced immersion DUV lithography systems, called the TWINSCAN NXT:2000i and subsequent tools.\\nThe Dutch government has used a different set of rules to restrict exports of ASML\\'s EUV machines since 2018. EUV exports however will now come under the law that comes into effect in September.\\nASML said it can start submitting export licenses before the law comes into effect and the government will grant or deny these applications on a case-by-case basis.\\nThe company added that it does not expect the measures announced on Friday to have a material impact on its 2023 financial outlook.\\nThe Chinese Embassy in the Netherlands called the latest law from the Dutch government \"an abuse of export control measures and seriously disrupted free trade and international trade rules.\"\\n\"We call on the Dutch side to bear in mind the larger interest of safeguarding international trade rules and bilateral economic and trade cooperation, immediately correct its wrongdoings,\" the embassy statement said.\\nThe embassy said it is ready to \"work with the Dutch side to address the issue\\u2002based on the principle of mutual benefit, so as to jointly promote the healthy development of Sino-Dutch economic and trade relations.\"\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Car-sharing service Turo filed its IPO prospectus in January 2022. A month earlier, Reddit said it submitted a draft registration for a public offering. Instacart\\'s confidential paperwork was filed in May of last year.\\nNone of them have hit the market yet.\\nDespite a bloated pipeline of companies waiting to go public and a rebound in tech stocks that pushed the Nasdaq up 30% in the first half of 2023, the IPO drought continues. There hasn\\'t been a notable venture-backed tech initial public offering in the U.S. since December 2021, when software vendor HashiCorp debuted on the Nasdaq.\\nAcross all industries, only 10 companies raised $100 million or more in U.S. initial share sales in the first six months of the year, according to FactSet. During the same stretch in 2021, there were 517 such transactions, highlighted by billion-dollar-plus IPOs from companies including dating site Bumble, online lender Affirm, and software developers UiPath and SentinelOne.\\nAs the second half of 2023 gets underway, investors and bankers aren\\'t expecting much champagne popping for the rest of the year.\\nMany once high-flying companies are still hanging onto their old valuations, failing to reconcile with a new reality after a brutal 2022. Additionally, muted economic growth has led businesses and consumers to cut costs and delay software purchases, which is making it particularly difficult for companies to comfortably forecast the next couple of quarters. Wall Street likes predictability.\\nSo if you\\'re waiting on a splashy debut from design software maker Canva, ticket site StubHub or data management company Databricks, be patient.\\n\"There\\'s a disconnect between valuations in 2021 and valuations today, and that\\'s a hard pill to swallow,\" said Lise Buyer, founder of IPO consultancy Class V Group in Portola Valley, California. \"There will be incremental activity after a period of absolute radio silence but it isn\\'t like companies are racing to get out the door.\"\\nThe public markets tell an uneven story. This year\\'s rally has brought the Nasdaq to within 15% of its record from late 2021, while an index of cloud stocks is still off by roughly 50%.\\nSome signs of optimism popped up this month as Mediterranean restaurant chain Cava went public on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock more than doubled on its first day of trading, indicating high demand from retail investors. Buyer noted that institutions were also enthused about the deal.\\nLast Friday, Israeli beauty and tech company Oddity, which runs the\\xa0Il Makiage and Spoiled Child\\xa0brands, filed to go public on the Nasdaq.\\nThat all comes after a big month for secondary offerings. According to data from Goldman Sachs, May was the busiest month for public stock sales since November 2021, driven by a jump in follow-on deals.\\nWhile investors are craving new names, they\\'re much more discerning when it comes to technology than they were at the tail end of the decade-long bull market.\\nMega-cap stocks Apple and Nvidia have seen outsized gains this year and are back to trading near all-time highs, boosting the Nasdaq because of their hefty weightings in the index. But the advances are not evenly spread across the industry.\\nIn particular, investors who bet on less mature businesses are still hurting. The companies that held the seven-biggest tech IPOs in the U.S. in 2021 have lost at least 40% of their value since their debut. Coinbase, which went public through a direct listing, is down more than 80%.\\nThat year\\'s IPO class featured high-growth businesses with even higher cash burn, an equation that worked fine until recession concerns and rising interest rates pushed investors into assets better positioned to withstand an economic slowdown and increased capital costs.\\nBankers and investors tell CNBC that optimism is picking up, but ongoing economic concerns and the valuation overhang from the pre-2022 era set the stage for a quiet second half for tech IPOs.\\nOne added challenge is that fixed income alternatives are back. Following a lengthy stretch of near-zero interest rates, the Federal Reserve this year lifted its target rate to between 5% and 5.25%. Parking money in short-term Treasurys, certificates of deposit and high-yield savings offerings can now generate annual returns of 5% or more.\\n\"Interest rates are not only about the cost of financing, but also getting investors to trade out of 5% risk-free returns,\" said Jake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management. \"You can make 15%-20% in the stock market but lose 15%-20%.\"\\nDollarhide, whose firm has invested in milestone tech offerings like Google and Facebook, says IPOs are important. They offer more opportunities for money managers, and they generate profits for the tech ecosystem that help fund the next generation of innovative companies.\\nBut he understands why there\\'s skepticism about the window reopening. Perhaps the biggest recent bust in tech investing followed the boom in special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), which brought scores of less mature companies to the public market through reverse mergers.\\nNames like Opendoor, Clover Health, 23andMe and Desktop Metal have lost more than 80% of their value since hitting the market via SPAC.\\n\"It seems the foul odor of failure from the 2021 SPAC craze has spoiled the appetite from investors seeking IPOs,\" Dollarhide said. \"I think that’s done some harm to the traditional IPO market.\"\\nPrivate markets have felt the impact. Venture funding slowed dramatically last year from record levels and has stayed relatively suppressed, outside of the red-hot area of artificial intelligence. Companies have been forced to cut staff and close offices in order to preserve cash and right-size their business\\nPre-IPO companies like Stripe, Canva and Klarna have taken huge hits to their valuations, either through internal measures or markdowns from outside investors.\\nFew have been hit as hard as Instacart, which has repeatedly slashed its valuation, from a peak of $39 billion to as low as $10 billion in late 2022. Last year, the company confidentially registered for an IPO, but still hasn\\'t filed publicly and doesn\\'t have immediate plans to do so.\\nSimilarly, Reddit said in December 2021 that it had confidentially submitted a draft registration statement to go public. That was before the online ad market took a dive, with Facebook suffering through three straight quarters of declining revenue and Google\\'s ad sales also slipping.\\nNow Reddit is in the midst of a business model shift, moving its focus beyond ads and toward generating revenue from third-party developers for the use of its data. But that change sparked a protest this month across a wide swath of Reddit\\'s most popular communities, leaving the company with plenty to sort through before it can sell itself to the public.\\nA Reddit spokesperson declined to comment.\\nTuro was so close to an IPO that it went beyond a confidential filing and published its full S-1 registration statement in January 2022. When stocks sold off, the offering was indefinitely delayed. To avoid withdrawing its filing, the company has to continue updating its quarterly results.\\nLike Instacart, Turo operates in the sharing economy, a dark spot for investors last year. Airbnb, Uber and DoorDash have all bounced back in 2023, but they\\'ve also instituted significant job cuts. Turo has gone in the opposite direction, more than doubling its full-time head count to 868 at the end of March from 429 at the time of its original IPO filing in 2021, according to its latest filing. The company reportedly laid off about 30% of its staff in 2020, during the Covid pandemic.\\nTuro and Instacart could still go public by year-end if market conditions continue to improve, according to sources familiar with the companies who asked not to be named because they weren\\'t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\\nByron Deeter, a cloud software investor at Bessemer Venture Partners, doesn\\'t expect any notable activity this year, and says the next crop of companies to debut will most likely wait until after showing their first-quarter results in 2024.\\n\"The companies that were on file or were considering going out a little over a year ago, they\\'ve pulled, stopped updating, and overwhelmingly have no plans to refile this calendar year,\" said Deeter, whose investments include Twilio and HashiCorp. \"We\\'re 10 months from the real activity picking up,\" Deeter said, adding that uncertainty around next year\\'s presidential election could lead to further delays.\\nIn the absence of IPOs, startups have to consider the fate of their employees, many of whom have a large amount of their net worth tied up in their company\\'s equity, and have been waiting years for a chance to sell some of it.\\nStripe addressed the issue in March, announcing that investors would buy $6.5 billion worth of employee shares. The move lowered the payment company\\'s valuation to about $50 billion from a high of $95 billion. Deeter said many late-stage companies are looking at similar transactions, which typically involve allowing employees to sell around 20% of their vested stock.\\nHe said his inbox fills up daily with brokers trying to \"schlep little blocks of shares\" from employees at late-stage startups.\\n\"The Stripe problem is real and the general liquidity problem is real,\" Deeter said. \"Employees are agitating for some path to liquidity. With the public market still pretty closed, they\\'re asking for alternatives.\"\\nG Squared is one of the venture firms active in buying up employee equity. Larry Aschebrook, the firm\\'s founder, said about 60% of G Squared\\'s capital goes to secondary purchases, helping companies provide some level of liquidity to staffers.\\nAschebrook said in an interview that transactions started to pick up in the second quarter of last year and continued to increase to the point where \"now it\\'s overwhelming.\" Companies and their employees have gotten more realistic about the market reset, so significant chunks of equity can now be purchased for 50% to 70% below valuations from 2021 financing rounds, he said.\\nBecause of nondisclosure agreements, Aschebrook said he couldn\\'t name any private company shares he\\'s purchased of late, but he said his firm previously bought pre-IPO secondary stock in Pinterest, Coursera, Spotify and Airbnb.\\n\"Right now there\\'s a significant need for that release of pressure,\" Aschebrook said. \"We\\'re assisting companies with elongating their private lifecycle and solving problems presented by staying private longer.\"\\nWATCH: The private market index is trading up for the first time in two years\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'On Friday, the White House released a federally mandated report on solar geoengineering, which is an umbrella term that describes methods of reflecting sunlight away from the earth to cool the atmosphere.\\nThe Biden-Harris administration has no plans underway to launch a comprehensive research program into solar radiation modification, according to a senior administration official.\\nBut the report also says there is good logic for a cohesive research agenda on this topic.\\n\"These unknowns, and the ever-evolving understanding of complex Earth systems, provide a compelling case for research to better understand both the potential benefits and risks,\" the report says.\\nThe report comes from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and was produced to fulfill a congressional mandate included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act passed in 2022, which asked the White House to develop a \"research governance framework to provide guidance on transparency, engagement, and risk management for publicly funded work in solar geoengineering research.\"\\nFor decades, solar radiation modification has been relegated to the realm of science fiction. But as the effects of climate change have become more obvious and dangerous, some argue that climate intervention may be less dangerous than the global warming that would happen without them.\\nHeat is a worthy adversary to mitigate — it\\'s\\xa0often called \"the silent killer\"\\xa0— but solar radiation management would not address other implications of climate change, like ocean acidification or air pollution.\\nThe White House report focuses on two methods of solar geoengineering.\\nStratospheric aerosol injection is releasing particles of sulfur dioxide or another substance into the upper atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from the Earth. Marine cloud brightening is meant to improve the reflectivity of certain clouds by injecting sea salt or through other methods.\\nFragmented research into solar radiation modification is already happening in federal science agencies, and research into topics like volcanic action and cloud-aerosol interactions could provide useful foundational knowledge.\\nVolcanic eruptions and large plumes of wildfire smoke provide a natural analog for engineered stratospheric aerosol injection. Ship tracks, which are clouds that form around ship exhaust, demonstrate the theory of marine cloud brightening.\\nBut research into solar radiation management is limited and uncoordinated, leaving substantial gaps. Having a research plan would help the United States prepare for deployment of solar radiation modification by another government or a private body.\\nSolar radiation management has the benefit of being fast. \"SRM offers the possibility of cooling the planet significantly on a timescale of a few years,\" the report says.\\nBut it also has a lot of unknown risks — what the White House report called \"known unknowns.\"\\nStratospheric aerosol injection could accelerate ozone depletion and reduce biodiversity, for example. Other known unknows include potential changes in patterns of precipitation, sea-level rise, terrestrial vegetation, coral reefs, crop production and other ecosystem changes. It could also harm human health by increasing particulate matter, for instance.\\nIn this context, the White House report calls for a \"\\'risk vs. risk\\' framing,\" where solar geoengineering would be studied in an effort to quantify the specific risks involved in deploying versus not deploying it.\\nFor example, allowing warming to proceed without solar radiation management might see more human death from extreme heat, but that would have to be compared against the health risks from more particulate matter in the air.\\nCritically, solar radiation modification is not a permanent solution. The only real solution to mitigating the effects of climate change is by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The report from the White House says that a research agenda into solar radiation modification would sit next to \"the foundational elements of greenhouse gas emissions mitigation and adaptation.\"\\nAlso on Wednesday, the European Union also formally addressed solar geoengineering, saying it is not a climate solution and that not enough is understood about these interventions to deploy them.\\nLike the United States, the European Union also says that solar geoengineering is not a climate solution and says the current level of understanding of the implications of such interventions is not sufficient to deploy them.\\n\"In the current state of development, a deliberate intervention in the Earth\\'s natural systems, such as a solar radiation modification (SRM) deployment, represents an unacceptable level of risk for humans and the environment,\" the European Commission stated in documents released on Wednesday.\\nHowever, the European Union also said it would support international, collective research into the topic.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'LONDON — The Bank of England is \"caught between a rock and a hard place\" as it prepares for a key monetary policy decision against a backdrop of sticky inflation and a tight labor market, economists say.\\nMay\\'s consumer price index figure will be published Wednesday morning, the day before the Bank\\'s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announces its next move on interest rates.\\nData points since the last meeting have indicated persistent tightness in the labor market and strong underlying inflationary pressures, alongside mixed but surprisingly resilient growth momentum.\\nEconomists therefore now expect the Bank to prolong its tightening cycle and lift interest rates to a higher level than previously anticipated.\\nBritish 2-year government bond yields rose to a 15-year high of 5% on Monday ahead of the expected announcement of yet another 25 basis point rate increase on Thursday.\\nSince November 2021, the the central bank has embarked on a series of hikes to take its base rate from 0.1% to 4.5%, and market pricing now suggests it may eventually top out at 5.75%.\\nHeadline CPI inflation came in at 8.7% year-on-year in April, down from 10.1% in March, but core CPI (which excludes volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices) increased by 6.8% compared to 6.2% the previous month.\\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development projected earlier this month that the U.K. will post annual headline inflation of 6.9% this year, the highest level among all advanced economies.\\nAdding to policymakers\\' collective headache, labor market data last week came in far stronger than expected. Unemployment defied expectations to fall back to 3.8% while the inactivity rate also fell by 0.4 percentage points.\\nRegular pay growth (excluding bonuses) was 7.2% in the three months to the end of April compared to the previous year, also exceeding consensus forecasts. Growth in regular private sector pay, the Bank\\'s key metric, hit 7.6% year-on-year.\\nIn terms of economic activity, May PMIs moderated slightly below consensus but remained in expansionary territory, and U.K. gross domestic product unexpectedly contracted by 0.3% month-on-month in March before rebounding partially with 0.2% growth in April.\\nIn a research note Thursday, Goldman Sachs Chief European Economist Sven Jari Stehn said that although some uncertainty remains over Wednesday\\'s CPI release, there is a \"high hurdle\" for the Bank of England to deem it necessary to step up its hiking increments to 50 basis points.\\nStehn highlighted that \"inflation expectations have remained anchored, recent comments have signalled no appetite for stepping up the pace and the meeting will have no press conference or new projections.\"\\n\"We look for the MPC to retain its modal assessment that underlying inflation pressures will cool as headline inflation declines but acknowledge the firmer recent data and note that risks to the inflation outlook remain skewed significantly to the upside. We also expect the MPC to keep its loose forward guidance unchanged,\" Stehn added.\\nGoldman Sachs expects the MPC to retain its relatively dovish position given resilient growth, sticky wage pressures and high core inflation, and to continue being pushed into more 25 basis point hikes by stronger-than-expected data, eventually reaching a terminal rate of 5.25% with risks skewed upside.\\nBNP Paribas economists also expect a 25 basis point hike on Thursday, as inflation expectations remain lower than they were when the Bank was lifting rates in 50 basis point increments last year.\\nThe French lender also upgraded its terminal rate forecast to 5.5% in a note last week, from 5% previously, in response to \"clear evidence of more persistent inflation.\"\\nThough the tightening cycle is expected to be longer than higher in order to reel in inflation, BNP Paribas suggested the MPC would be \"wary of over-tightening\" and will be looking to gauge how rate rises to date affect households, particularly as fixed-rate mortgage renewals roll in through the second and third quarter.\\nU.K. mortgage borrowers are being pushed to the brink as rising borrowing costs hit deal renewals and products are pulled from the market.\\nLaith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, said the MPC is \"caught between a rock and a hard place\" as it chooses between pushing more mortgage borrowers to a cliff edge and allowing inflation to run riot.\\n\"Current interest rate pricing reflects alarm bells ringing in the market, but some moderation in inflationary pressures over the summer would pour balm on the situation. The Bank of England will also be cognisant of the fact the full force of its tightening to date is still working its way through the economy,\" Khalaf said.\\n\"Having said that, should inflation data remain ugly, the Bank will be under pressure to take action, and so will the Treasury, if it looks like the Prime Minister\\'s pledge to halve inflation is at risk of falling short.\"\\n',\n",

I think they have to be on hold for much longer,\" she said.\\nThe ECB began raising rates in July 2022 and has increased its main rate from -0.5% to 3.5% since then. The U.S. Federal Reserve, meanwhile, embarked on a hiking cycle in March 2022 but opted to pause this month, diverging from Europe. Nonetheless, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has suggested there could be at least two more rate hikes this year.\\nA survey of U.S. economists in late May showed they had pushed back their expectations for the Fed to cut rates from the final quarter of this year to the first quarter of 2024. In a note to clients on Friday, Nomura said it expects both the ECB and the Bank of England to announce rate cuts in about a year\\'s time.\\nHowever, for the IMF it is clear that reducing inflation needs to be the absolute priority.\\n\"It is taking too long for inflation to come back to target that means that central banks will have to remain committed to fighting Inflation even if that means risking weaker growth or much more cooling in the labor market,\" Gopinath said.\\nIn the case of the ECB, the central bank raised its expectations for inflation in the euro zone at its last meeting in June. It now expects headline inflation at 5.4% this year, at 3% in 2024 and at 2.2% in 2025.\\nGopinath described the current macroeconomic picture as \"very uncertain.\"\\nGoldman analysts said in a note on Friday they expect the Fed to make the first rate cuts in the second quarter of next year and the ECB in the final quarter of 2024.\\nSpeaking to CNBC\\'s \"Street Signs Europe\" Tuesday, Frederik Ducrozet, head of macroeconomic research at Pictet Wealth Management, said it simply comes down to the fact that we don\\'t know \"when enough will be enough\" when it comes to rate increases.\\nMeanwhile, ECB Governing Council\\xa0member\\xa0Mārtiņš Kazāks also told CNBC he believed markets were pricing in cuts too early.\\n\"Currently I think the markets are making the mistake of thinking the rates will come down much, much quicker, which in my view is inconsistent with the baseline we currently have,\" Kazāks said at the Sintra Forum.\\n\"First off, next year is way too early. I would see personally for rates to start coming down, for rate cuts to be necessary, is only when we see that inflation does significantly and persistently fall below our target of 2%.\"\\n',\n",

The move came as several hundred employees signed a petition opposing the drag performance, claiming that it was offensive to their Christian religion and that they\\'d complained to human resources.\\nThe company said the event hadn\\'t gone through the proper approval process but didn\\'t comment on the petition.\\nAttendees and Grannell said they viewed the change as a buckling to pressure of the Christian employees\\' petition and complaints.\\n\"I was called all sorts of things,\" Grannell said on stage, referring to the petition. \"Boo!\" more attendees yelled. \"We support you!\" one employee yelled from the crowd.\\nBoth employees and Grannell told CNBC they were disappointed in the company for backtracking, adding that Google held a similar event last year without any problems.\\nAttendees described Grannell as an \"icon\" and \"an institution\" in the gay community.\\n\"I\\'ve been a performer for nearly 30 years in San Francisco, and I employ hundreds of people, performers and artists across the city,\" Grannell told CNBC.\\n\"This thing that happened with Google, unfortunately for this event, is actually indicative of a huge groundswell of hatred across the country using drag queens and trans people as scapegoats,\" he told the crowd Tuesday, which garnered more boos and yelling.\\nDrag shows have been a target of religious and conservative organizations and politicians leading up to the 2024 presidential election. That includes\\xa0a flurry of legislative proposals\\xa0backed by Republican governors attempting to limit drag events.\\xa0\\nCorporations have also faced backlash for Pride-related marketing. Bud Light came into the crosshairs after it struck a partnership with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney, while North Face received backlash for an ad featuring drag queen Pattie Gonia. Target and Kohl\\'s have been criticized for Pride-themed clothing.\\nFollowing Grannell\\'s opening monologue, he repeated the reason for the event was to celebrate Pride and then proceeded to introduce the performers on a small stage toward the back of the venue, which held rainbow-colored lights.\\nThe first performer sang in a sequenced Marilyn Monroe-style red dress to Diana Ross\\' upbeat \"The Boss.\" The next performer dawned a large, multicolor coat who danced to Gloria Gaynor\\'s \"I will survive.\"\\nA few others followed, with their own unique acts. Some were comedic musical skits, others featured dancing and lip-syncing.\\n\"For me, it\\'s real bummer to see this happen but I also think it needs to be called out,\" Grannell told CNBC after the show, referring to Google\\'s decision to distance itself from the planned event. \"If you\\'re going to put a rainbow flag on stuff and march in the queer Pride parade but not support your queer employees and not take a stand against anti-queer sentiment, even in the name of religion, then you\\'re not a real ally.\"\\nGrannell said the stakes for a lot of drag performers are high, as some of them have come to rely on corporate sponsorship. \"We\\'ve now created a culture where corporations\\' allyship includes paying performers and paying queer people to celebrate Pride month. Google sets a standard for a lot of companies in the industry and in San Francisco,\" he added.\\nAttendees and employees alike danced, cheered and took turns walking dollar bills to the stage throughout the nearly two-hour event.\\n\"You have some work to do, Googlers,\" Grannell told the crowd as he ended the show. \"We\\'ve got to keep fighting and we will win—we\\'re on the right side of history.\"\\nThe crowd erupted in applause and cheers.\\nGoogle did not respond to a request for comment.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'The Federal Trade Commission on Friday proposed a new rule that seeks to ban fake online reviews, marking its most aggressive step yet to thwart review fraud.\\nThe proposed rule would prohibit companies from buying or selling fake reviews and suppressing negative reviews, as well as \"review hijacking,\" which involves repurposing positive reviews from one item for use on other listings, and can make new or questionable products appear trustworthy. It also bars company executives or insiders from leaving reviews of their products or services without disclosing their relationships.\\n\"The rule would trigger civil penalties for violators and should help level the playing field for honest companies,\" said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC\\'s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.\\nFake reviews and review abuse have been a persistent issue for online platforms such as Amazon, Google and Yelp. Bad actors often rely on fake reviews to boost their products in search results and drive more sales. In some cases, companies offer to pay users to leave negative reviews on a competitor\\'s product, a tactic called \"review sabotage.\"\\nAs review fraud has become more prevalent, a shadowy economy of online businesses has sprung up promising to supply companies with fake reviews, often for as little as a few bucks apiece. Some of these businesses advertise their services through their website, while others set up invite-only Facebook groups and Telegram chats.\\nAmazon, which has struggled to combat fake reviews on its third-party marketplace, has increasingly gone after fake review brokers and Facebook group administrators in court. It also uses a combination of human moderators and machine-learning tools to try to detect suspicious activity on its site.\\nThe FTC has increasingly cracked down on fake reviews as they \"deceive consumers looking for real feedback on a product or service and undercut honest businesses,\" the agency said. In February, the FTC brought its first case against review hijacking when it fined supplement maker Bountiful Co., which makes the popular vitamin brand Nature\\'s Bounty, for using the tactic to boost its Amazon listings.\\nThe agency has filed several other cases in recent years against companies that used fake reviews to sell products online, and blocked their users from leaving negative reviews.\\nIn its announcement Friday, the FTC acknowledged that the widespread emergence of generative artificial intelligence will likely make it easier for bad actors to write fake reviews. CNBC previously reported that some people are already using AI chatbots to write reviews on Amazon.\\nThe proposed rule does not take effect immediately. There is a 60-day public comment period, and then the agency may reevaluate the rule based on the comments it receives. After some time, the FTC will vote on a final version of its proposal.\\nWATCH: Many of the reviews on Amazon are fake, here\\'s how to spot them\\n',\n",

Google reported $40.69 billion in Search revenue for the second quarter of 2023.\\nGoogle\\'s global affairs president, Kent Walker, called the framework of the new law \"unworkable\" in a blog post and said it would expose the company to \"uncapped financial liability simply for facilitating Canadians\\' access to news from Canadian publishers.\"\\nMeta already said it would begin blocking Canadian news outlets from appearing on Facebook or Instagram after the bill\\'s passage.

       "    'content': 'The Aigen Element looks like a drafting table on rugged tires. It drives itself continuously at around two miles per hour over farmland, using an advanced computer vision system to identify crops and unwanted botanical invaders.\\nWith two-axis robotic arms positioned close the ground, the Element can flick weeds out of the way where they\\'ll dry out before they can grow seeds and spread.\\nThe robots, which are used in a fleet and sized to meet the needs of a particular growing operation, work continuously for 12 to 14 hours at a time and never need to be plugged in. They are equipped with a lithium iron phosphate battery pack, as well as flexible solar panels which are lighter than the kind typically used on rooftops. They can even run in the dark for about four hours, or six hours in light to moderate rain — all without the emissions associated with diesel-powered farm equipment.\\nThe company behind the robots, Aigen, was founded by Rich Wurden, an ex-Tesla engineer, along with former Proofpoint executive Kenny Lee in 2020.\\nAccording to the most recent data available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. pesticide usage reached more than 1.1 billion pounds annually by 2012, with herbicides accounting for nearly 60% of that. Glyphosate was the most used active ingredient that year, with 270 million to 290 million pounds used then, and it had been since 2001.\\nReducing growers\\' over-reliance on pesticides and heavy use of chemicals in the global food supply is of personal importance to Wurden and Lee. Both founders and several employees in their 15-person team have experienced significant health issues associated with exposure to pesticides.\\nWurden, who is Aigen\\'s CTO, comes from a family of farmers who grew sugarbeets in Minnesota. Now, he says, his family\\'s farm grows sorghum and soy.\\n\"My pancreas stopped producing insulin when I was 15 all of a sudden,\" he said. He always suspected pesticide exposure, which is associated with a higher risk of diabetes, was a factor.\\nAs a type 1 diabetic, he lives with an insulin pump with environmental health on his mind every day since his diagnosis.\\nBefore becoming an entrepreneur, Wurden worked as a mechanical engineer and on battery technology at Tesla, helping to create the battery pack that is found in the company\\'s best-selling Model 3 and Y vehicles and Model S flagship sedan. He later joined an electric boating startup called Pure Watercraft in Seattle, where he says he caught something of the startup bug.\\nLee, who is Aigen\\'s CEO, overcame non-Hodgkins lymphoma as a young man, and says he\\'s interested in both personal and planetary health following a career in cybersecurity, where he was more focused on making the internet a safer place for all. (Lee was co-founder of Weblife.io, which was acquired by Proofpoint in a deal valued around $60 million in 2017.)\\nWurden and Lee met in a Slack channel created by nonprofit Work on Climate where tech industry veterans discussed how to pivot or grow their careers while combating the climate crisis.\\nFarmers want the ability to identify exactly when and where insects are showing up so they can eliminate those that pose a risk, for example. They also want irrigation-related analytics, which would tell them whether their plants are getting enough water, and whether some parts of the field may need more irrigation than others.\\nTypically, a fleet of the Element robots would pass over the field continuously, gathering data each time. Currently, the system can provide what farmers call a \"stand count,\" analyzing how many healthy plants are in the field.\\nThe Aigen Element runs\\xa0on solar and wind power, completely off the power grid. It also runs its analytics and AI-machine learning software on the device, rather than in the cloud. Because of that, Lee said, the company has the potential to give farmers more extensive crop analytics.\\n\"While we\\'re taking weeding actions, we can do other things that no other agtech can because we\\'re mobile on the ground.\"\\nThe Element could also help farmers work around a persistent labor shortage in agriculture, and keep their crops healthy even during extreme heat that would make it hostile for people to stay out in the field weeding.\\nAccording to Trent Eidem, who has signed up to put the Aigen Element to work at his sugarbeet growing operation near Fargo, the robots are also appealing because they could reduce the amount of money that growers have to spend on costly \"inputs,\" namely herbicides. Crop inputs and energy are his biggest budget items, Eidem said.\\nIn the next year, the company plans to build and bring more of their robots to farmers -- and to develop additional capabilities for them, too.\\nAigen has raised around $7 million in early-stage funding and additional grant money from the state of Idaho to develop their system.\\nInvestors include a mix of tech and climate-focused seed and venture funds: NEA, Global Founders, Regen Ventures, Bessemer, Climate Tech VC, Cleveland Ave., and a climate fund founded by ex-Meta exec Mike Schroepfer.\\nNEA Partner Andrew Schoen, who invests in emerging tech, told CNBC that Aigen founders\\' track record in both software and hardware and ability to build an \"autonomous ground robot\" before raising any funding gave him confidence to invest. He also said Aigen is tackling a massive pain point for farmers, representing a potentially massive market.\\nAccording to forecasts by Fortune Business Insights, the global market for pesticides, or \"crop protection products,\" is expected to exceed $80 billion by 2028. Increasingly, the investor believes agricultural producers will include robotics, not just chemical inputs, in their mix.\\n',\n",

       "    'content': 'Over half of all new cars sold in the U.S. by 2030 are expected to be electric vehicles. That could put a major strain on our nation\\'s electric grid, an aging system built for a world that runs on fossil fuels.\\nDomestic electricity demand in 2022 is expected to increase up to 18% by 2030 and 38% by 2035, according to an analysis by the Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit, or REPEAT, an energy policy project out of Princeton University. That\\'s a big change over the roughly 5% increase we saw in the past decade.\\n\"So we\\'ve got a lot of power demand coming to this country when we really didn\\'t have any for the last, like, 25 years,\" said Rob Gramlich, founder and president of Grid Strategies, a transmission policy group.\\nWhile many parts of the economy are moving away from fossil fuels toward electrification — think household appliances such as stoves, and space heating for homes and offices — the transportation sector is driving the increase. Light-duty vehicles, a segment that excludes large trucks and aviation, are projected to use up to 3,360% more electricity by 2035 than they do today, according to Princeton\\'s data.\\nBut electrification is only an effective decarbonization solution if it\\'s paired with a major buildout of renewable energy. \"So we have both supply-side and demand-side drivers of big grid needs,\" Gramlich said.\\nThat means we need major changes to the grid: more high-voltage transmission lines to transport electricity from rural wind and solar power plants to demand centers; smaller distribution lines and transformers for last-mile electricity delivery; and hardware such as inverters that allow customers with home batteries, EVs and solar panels to feed excess energy back into the grid.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s not going to be cheap. In a study commissioned by the California Public Utilities Commission, grid analytics company Kevala forecasts that California alone will have to spend $50 billion by 2035 in distribution grid upgrades to meet its ambitious EV targets.\\nCharging electric vehicles is quite electricity intensive. While a direct comparison with appliances depends on many variables, an owner of a new Tesla Model 3 who drives the national average of around 14,000 miles per year would use about the same amount of electricity charging their vehicle at home as they would on their electric water heater over the course of a year, and about 10 times more electricity than it would take to power a new, energy-efficient refrigerator. Larger electric vehicles such as the Ford F-150 Lightning would generally use more electricity than a central AC unit in a large home.\\xa0\\nLydia Krefta, director of clean energy transportation at PG&E, said the utility currently has about 470,000 electric vehicles connected to the grid in its service territory of Northern and Central California and is aiming for 3 million by 2030.\\nGiven that PG&E\\'s territory covers about 1 in 7 electric vehicles in the U.S., how it handles the EV transition could serve as a model for the nation. It\\'s no easy task. The utility is tied to a four-year funding cycle for grid infrastructure upgrades, and its last funding request was in 2021. Now that funding will definitely fall short of what\\'s needed, Krefta said.\\n\"A lot of the analysis that went into that request came from, like, 2019 or 2020 forecasts, in particular some of those older EV forecasts that didn\\'t anticipate some of the growth that we believe we\\'re more likely to see now,\" Krefta said. This situation has PG&E applying for numerous state and federal grants that could help it meet its electrification targets.\\n\"I think right now people have an overly simplistic view of what electrification of transportation means,\" said Kevala CEO Aram Shumavon. \"If done right, it will be phenomenal; if mismanaged, there are going to be a lot of upset people, and that is a real risk. That\\'s a risk for regulators. That\\'s a risk for politicians, and that\\'s a risk for utilities.\"\\nShumavon said that if grid infrastructure doesn\\'t keep up with the EV boom, drivers can expect charging difficulties such as long queues or only being able to charge at certain times and places. An overly strained grid will also be more vulnerable to extreme weather events and prone to blackouts, which California experienced in 2020.\\nThe most straightforward way to meet growing electricity demand is to bring more energy sources online, preferably green ones. But though it\\'s easy to site coal and natural gas plants close to population centers, the best solar and wind resources are usually more rural.\\nThat means what the U.S. really needs is more high-voltage transmission lines, which can transport solar and wind resources across county and state lines.\\nBut Gramlich said that while we\\'re constantly spending money replacing and upgrading old lines, we\\'re hardly building any new ones. \"I think we need probably about $20 [billion] or $30 billion a year on new capacity, new line miles and new delivery capacity. We\\'re spending close to zero on that right now.\"\\nThere are major regulatory hurdles when it comes to building new transmission lines, which often cross through multiple counties, states and utility service areas, all of which need to approve of the line and agree on how to finance it.\\n\"If you just think about a line crossing two or three dozen different utility territories, they have a way to recover their costs on their local system, but they kind of throw up their hands when there\\'s something that benefits three dozen utilities, and who\\'s supposed to pay, how much, and how are we going to decide?\" Gramlich said.\\nPermitting is a major holdup as well. All new energy projects must undergo a series of impact studies to evaluate what new transmission equipment is required, how much it will cost and who will pay. But the list of projects stuck in this process is massive. The total amount of electricity generation in the queues, almost all of which is renewable, exceeds the total generating capacity on the grid today.\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act has the potential to cut emissions by about 1 billion tons by 2030, according to Princeton\\'s REPEAT project. But by this same analysis, if transmission infrastructure buildout doesn\\'t more than double its historical growth rate of 1% per year, more than 80% of these reductions could be lost.\\nEfforts are underway to expedite the energy infrastructure buildout. Most notably, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., introduced a permitting reform bill in May after similar measures failed last year. President Joe Biden has thrown his support behind the bill, which would speed up permitting for all types of energy projects, including fossil fuel infrastructure. The politics will be tricky to navigate, though, as many Democrats view the bill as overly friendly to fossil fuel interests.\\nBut even if the pace of permitting accelerates and we start spending big on transmission soon, it will still take years to build the infrastructure that\\'s needed.\\n\"There\\'s going to be an in-between period where the need is very high, but the transmission can\\'t be built during the time period where the need happens, and distributed energy resources are going to play a very active role in managing that process, because no other resources will be available,\" Shumavon explained.\\nThat means that resources such as\\xa0residential solar and battery systems could help stabilize the grid as customers generate their own power and sell excess electricity back to the grid. Automakers are also increasingly equipping their EVs with bidirectional charging capabilities, which allow customers to use their giant EV battery packs to power their homes or provide electricity back to the grid, just like a regular home battery system. Tesla doesn\\'t currently offer this functionality, but has indicated that it will in the coming years, while other models such as the Ford F-150 Lightning and Nissan Leaf already do.\\nThere will also likely be greater emphasis on energy efficiency and energy timing use. PG&E, for example, is thinking about how to optimize charging times for large electric vehicle fleets.\\n\"One thing that we\\'re trying to do is to work with some of these companies that are putting in substantial loads to provide flexible load constraints where we can say you can only charge 50 EVs at 7 p.m., but at 2 a.m. you can charge all 100,\" Krefta said.\\nKrefta hopes constraints on charging times are temporary, though, and said that moving forward, PG&E is looking to incentivize consumers through dynamic pricing, in which electricity prices are higher during times of peak demand and lower at off-peak hours. And the utility is working with automakers to figure out how electric vehicles can provide maximum benefit to the grid.\\n\"What kinds of things do you need to do in your garage to enable your vehicle to power your home? How can you leverage your vehicle to charge whenever there\\'s renewables on the grid and they\\'re clean and low cost and then discharge back to the grid during the evening hours?\" Krefta said it\\'s questions like these that will help create the green grid of the future.\\nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect that Rob Gramlich estimated the U.S. should be spending about $20 billion or $30 billion on new transmission capacity per year. An earlier version misstated the amounts.\\nWatch the video to learn more about how the U.S. power grid can prepare for the boom in electric vehicles.\\n',\n",

He was referring to Hong Kong as a testing bed for Meituan which may eventually expand internationally.\\nThe penetration rate of food delivery in Hong Kong is not particularly high.\\nCurrently, about 10% of the overall restaurant industry\\xa0taps on food delivery services — that\\'s compared to an average of 21% across China two years ago, according to a report from research firm Momentum Works.\\nThat\\'s because \"ordering food delivery is not as common a habit in Hong Kong as it is in mainland China,\" said\\xa0the report, adding that the\\xa0Asian financial hub\\xa0has a high density of food and beverage establishments on every street corner.\\nAnalysts reveal a $12 billion opportunity to tap the A.I. buzz, naming stocks to play it\\nForget Nvidia: Fund manager says buy these two chip giants instead, giving one 30% upside\\nApple\\'s Vision Pro or Meta\\'s Quest? Analysts prefer one to play the future of VR tech\\nHong Kong\\'s food delivery market is currently dominated by Foodpanda and Deliveroo, which held shares of 64% and 36% respectively in May before KeeTa\\'s launch, according to data provider Measurable AI. The data takes into account both delivery and pickup orders.\\xa0\\nKeeTa does not currently offer food pickup services, only delivery services.\\nUber Eats\\xa0exited Hong Kong\\xa0at the end of 2021 after five years of operating in the territory. It held about 5% market share at the time of its exit, according to Measurable AI.\\n\"If there has already been like two or three major players in this market, then it\\'s actually very difficult to change consumers\\' mindsets, unless they do a lot of subsidy campaigns,\" said Yang of Blue Lotus Research.\\n″[KeeTa\\'s expansion into Hong Kong] should lead to more vouchers and discounts for consumers. And it should benefit consumers in the long term,\" said Wang from Morningstar.\\nSeparately, Hong Kong has launched a probe into\\xa0anti-competitive\\xa0conduct from Deliveroo and Foodpanda. That means players cannot engage in practices such as restricting restaurants or penalizing them for switching to partnering exclusively with other platforms. \\nThis could mean smaller players such as KeeTa may be able to build market share.\\nIn a bid to acquire new users, KeeTa is\\xa0offering 300 Hong Kong dollars ($38.30) worth of free vouchers for each new user\\xa0that can be used to offset meals and delivery fees. The company\\xa0\"plans to further launch various marketing activities in the new district\" such as free delivery for all, as well as referral discounts and food deals.\\nKeeTa is also offering set meals from HK$60 including delivery fees to address the painpoint of customers who dine alone.

That\\'s far above the 200,000 views that a Nio car launch livestream drew in late 2021.\\nIn another page from Nio\\'s playbook, the Denza N7 launch in Beijing was followed by a live music performance.\\nMercedes-Benz Group has a 10% stake in the Denza brand. Its prior electric model, the D9 multi-purpose vehicle, claims more than 10,000 sales a month since since March. That car is available in Thailand, and is set for release in Hong Kong, Macao and Europe, a brand representative said Monday, without sharing dates.\\nFrom fast battery charging and in-house driving assist tech, to an array of in-car entertainment, the Denza N7 launch showed off features in stiff competition with what Nio, Tesla and other leading players in China\\'s electric car market offer.\\n\"Denza N7 is the first luxury SUV to penetrate the market of BBA,\" a slide at the launch event read in English, referring to the trio of high-end German brands Benz, BMW and Audi.\\nIn an in-person presentation Monday, Denza\\'s general manager of sales, Zhao Changjiang noted the N7\\'s data privacy features like independent chip storage and the ability to turn off cameras.\\nThe Denza N7 also claimed to come with an augmented reality head-up display — which uses AR tech to project information digitally over the road in front of the driver. Certain models include BYD\\'s new shock absorption technology for smoother rides, which domestic rivals have yet to sell.\\nYang Dongsheng, vice president of BYD, touted driver-assist technology using Qualcomm chips and Nvidia Orin, which is commonly used in assisted driving systems. Orin isn\\'t affected by the U.S. bans on Nvidia\\'s sales of more advanced chips to China.\\nThe car cockpit also connect with the Android smartphone operating system, Yang said.\\nEV startups conserve cash as make-or-break moment approaches.

He was referring to Hong Kong as a testing bed for Meituan which may eventually expand internationally.\\nThe penetration rate of food delivery in Hong Kong is not particularly high.\\nCurrently, about 10% of the overall restaurant industry\\xa0taps on food delivery services — that\\'s compared to an average of 21% across China two years ago, according to a report from research firm Momentum Works.\\nThat\\'s because \"ordering food delivery is not as common a habit in Hong Kong as it is in mainland China,\" said\\xa0the report, adding that the\\xa0Asian financial hub\\xa0has a high density of food and beverage establishments on every street corner.\\nAnalysts reveal a $12 billion opportunity to tap the A.I. buzz, naming stocks to play it\\nForget Nvidia: Fund manager says buy these two chip giants instead, giving one 30% upside\\nApple\\'s Vision Pro or Meta\\'s Quest? Analysts prefer one to play the future of VR tech\\nHong Kong\\'s food delivery market is currently dominated by Foodpanda and Deliveroo, which held shares of 64% and 36% respectively in May before KeeTa\\'s launch, according to data provider Measurable AI. The data takes into account both delivery and pickup orders.\\xa0\\nKeeTa does not currently offer food pickup services, only delivery services.\\nUber Eats\\xa0exited Hong Kong\\xa0at the end of 2021 after five years of operating in the territory. It held about 5% market share at the time of its exit, according to Measurable AI.\\n\"If there has already been like two or three major players in this market, then it\\'s actually very difficult to change consumers\\' mindsets, unless they do a lot of subsidy campaigns,\" said Yang of Blue Lotus Research.\\n″[KeeTa\\'s expansion into Hong Kong] should lead to more vouchers and discounts for consumers. And it should benefit consumers in the long term,\" said Wang from Morningstar.\\nSeparately, Hong Kong has launched a probe into\\xa0anti-competitive\\xa0conduct from Deliveroo and Foodpanda. That means players cannot engage in practices such as restricting restaurants or penalizing them for switching to partnering exclusively with other platforms. \\nThis could mean smaller players such as KeeTa may be able to build market share.\\nIn a bid to acquire new users, KeeTa is\\xa0offering 300 Hong Kong dollars ($38.30) worth of free vouchers for each new user\\xa0that can be used to offset meals and delivery fees. The company\\xa0\"plans to further launch various marketing activities in the new district\" such as free delivery for all, as well as referral discounts and food deals.\\nKeeTa is also offering set meals from HK$60 including delivery fees to address the painpoint of customers who dine alone. Foodpanda and Deliveroo\\'s minimum order requirements typically range from HK$50 to HK$80 excluding delivery fees, according to a CNBC check.\\nTo entice customers further, KeeTa launched an \"on-time promise\" policy to all users. Customers get compensated in vouchers if their orders are\\xa0more than 15 minutes later than the original estimate.\\nRyan Lai, managing director of Foodpanda Hong Kong, told CNBC that short-term promotions are not enough to establish customer loyalty in the longer run.\\n\"In such a competitive market landscape, we find that building strong customer stickiness is a key success factor,\" said Lai.\\n\"In our opinion, the entry of a new player in the local delivery space reflects the untapped growth potential of this industry in the market,\" he said, adding that Foodpanda will continue to serve its customers better.\\nOn the new entrant, a Deliveroo Hong Kong spokesperson said, \"Since Deliveroo first entered the Hong Kong market seven years ago, we have always been optimistic about the prospects of the local food and grocery industry, and as such, we see competition as a driving force for innovation.\"\\nRecently, the platform also launched the \"on-time promise\" policy for paid users — which compensates them with vouchers if their orders are late by 15 minutes or more.\\nHowever, the food delivery market in Hong Kong \"remains lukewarm,\" said Momentum Works in the report, which pointed out that\\xa0even during the pandemic, growth rates were moderate.\\nBut KeeTa can tap into its parent company\\'s expertise in China, said the research firm.\\n\"As long as Meituan has\\xa0determined leadership, selects\\xa0the right people, and\\xa0organizes its internal structure effectively, they should not worry about competition from the two incumbents.\"', metadata={'source': '/Users/sanjay/Documents/Code/Python/scrapy_python/llm/temp/news_2023-07-04/10.txt'})"

Musk changed the limits several times on Saturday, at one point announcing that verified accounts could view 10,000 posts a day, while unverified accounts could view 1,000 and new unverified accounts could view 500. Users report seeing a \"Rate limit exceeded\" error message when they have viewed their allotted number of posts.\\nAs a result, people have been turning to Bluesky, an emerging text-based social media site backed by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Bluesky is still in an invite-only beta phase, and the company said in a post Saturday that its systems were experiencing \"some degraded performance as a result of record-high traffic.\" The platform also had to temporarily pause sign-ups to address performance issues.\\nBluesky resumed sign-ups late Sunday.\\nTwitter answered CNBC\\'s request for comment with an automated response. Bluesky did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nBluesky was originally incubated within Twitter back in 2019 when Dorsey was still CEO. The app runs on a decentralized networking technology called the AT Protocol, which in theory could power future social apps, enabling people to maintain their identities across multiple platforms.\\nIn February 2022, members of the Bluesky project\\xa0created\\xa0the Bluesky Public Benefit LLC, with Jay Graber as CEO and Dorsey as one of the founding board members. The company\\xa0announced\\xa0on Twitter in April 2022 that it received $13 million in funding \"to ensure we have the freedom and independence to get started on R&D.\"\\nBy the end of April this year, Bluesky reached more than 50,000 users, according to its website.\\nBluesky is not the only emerging Twitter competitor. The decentralized messaging app Mastodon\\xa0attracted significant interest in November, and social media giant Meta\\xa0previously confirmed\\xa0to CNBC that it was \"exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text updates.\"\\nMeta may be readying for launch, as The Verge reported Saturday that Meta\\'s Twitter competitor, called Threads, briefly appeared in the Google Play store.\\nMeta did not immediately respond to CNBC\\'s request for comment.\\n— CNBC\\'s Jonathan Vanian contributed to this report.', metadata={'source': '/Users/sanjay/Documents/Code/Python/scrapy_python/llm/temp/news_2023-07-04/11.txt'}),\n",
